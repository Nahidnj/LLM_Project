            [My coworker and I went to a local bar after work.  We hung out at the bar for a bit talking and having a good laugh.  We saw some cute girls walk in and walk to the other end of the bar.  We smiled at them and eventually made our way over to them after watching them for a bit to see if anyone was with them.  We ordered them drinks and paid for them. We got them some small appetizers too.  We laughed for hours and chatted about everything under the sun.  I really liked the one girl who had dark hair and dark eyes.  She was a beauty and a bit mysterious.  She carried herself well and had a pretty dress on.  We talked about our dogs.  How we both love animals.  I could tell she had a gentle spirit about her.  Come to find out she knows my cousin.  They work together at the hospital.  I could tell she liked me and was touching my arm here and there. My coworker had to leave so I invited the girl back to my place to hang out and talk some more.  We ended up talking all night long.  We both had to get up and go to work but went out that next night again.  Here it is 5 months later and we have been together as a couple for four months.  We go out and hang out just about every single day.] =",imagined, imag,imagined

            [The feel of the open road passing beneath my feet. The roar of the Harley between my legs. The wind blowing over me. What a rush to finally be out on the road, driving up PCH. I think back to five months ago when I got my motorcycle license.  I was so nervous. They have you drive around a little track at the DMV. This is the hardest part because I had to ride my motorcycle around some obstacles. Getting on and finishing my turn was scary. I was the fifth one out of ten people that Saturday morning. Thanks to Governer Newsom, I was able to complete my test on a Saturday instead of taking time off work. This test looks easy, but getting on the bike and actually doing it is a whole nother story. But I did it! I passed that little DMV obstacle couse, finished my turn and got my motorcycle license! And now here I am, driving from up the coast with no destination in mind other than being on my bike.] =",imagined, imag,imagined

            [2 weeks ago, I woke up more excited than ever because it was finally the day that I was going to be able to see my best friend Hollie for the first time in over a YEAR! She'd  been away working in another country and she just moved back to our city earlier this month. The first thing I did that morning was text her and see where she wanted to go. She recommended the local cafe that we used to go to for lunch all of the time before she left. Best of all? This was going to be a girl's day, just the two of us, NO BOYFRIEND ALLOWED. I drove to meet her at 12:30 p.m. and we met in the parking lot at about 12:45. When I saw her, I almost started to cry and I think she did, too. She was my best friend, my person, my soul sister, and we were finally reunited after what felt like 10 years. We hugged each other in the parking lot and neither of us wanted to let go... until we realized just how hungry we were. Letting each other go, we were already starting to catch up on things when we entered the restaurant, and we even got our favorite table: the one right next to the window. It finally felt like everything was falling back together again! I asked her about her time away and she spent time asking me about Cory (my boyfriend) and I, and if we had finally tied the knot yet. I told her we were thinking about it, and as soon as he popped the question, she would be my maid of honor for sure. I told her I couldn't imagine a wedding without her in it, and then she started to get quiet. She was tearing up, and I didn't know why. I thought I said something to offend her? Maybe she was upset that I brought Cory into the conversation? I asked her what was wrong after a few minutes of silence and I already knew something major had happened before she spoke... and then she told me the truth. The reason she had moved back home is because she was diagnosed with colon cancer. She wanted to begin her treatments at home, surrounded by her close friends and family, because she didn't know how effective they would be. The cancer had already progressed before it was diagnosed. I wanted to cry, too, but I didn't want to make her upset. I promised her that day that I would fight with her every step of the way, and no matter what happened, she wouldn't be alone.] =",imagined, imag,imagined

            [I got up early today, I had to go and visit my grandmother at the retirement home today. The bus ride there always takes about 45 min, Today there was a lady riding the whole way there with me. I wonder who she was going to see. The weather today was a bit cold and clammy and I should have worn my boots over shoes. I got there around 10am, which is right after breakfast which is always a good time to go a visit as everyone is wide awake. The most interesting woman was sitting and talking to my grandmother when I arrived. My grandmother introduce her as Edith and she moved here from Estonia shortly after the war.  She told me about how she been in some of the pride rallies back then. That she had seen Hitler speak before he came to power and liked him. It was interesting to listen to someone who was welcoming of the Nazi party when they invaded her country. But after learning of the crimes the Nazi's did feels sad about ever liking Hitler. We spoke for about an hour and she told me all about her family life during the war. I stayed until after lunch and took the same bus home. The lady from earlier wasn't on the bus again, I wonder if she left already? Got home and made dinner for myself. I'm tired today and plan to get to sleep early.] =",imagined, imag,imagined

            [I was sitting with my friend at a restaurant we usually go to. It's a casual sit down place so there are a variety of families cultures and people that visit. We went about 2 weeks ago to celebrate a promotion I had just gotten at work. I was really enjoying myself and thought my friend was too. He had been drinking some, but nothing excessive or out of the ordinary for him.  Our waiter was Hispanic and was super attentive and friendly.  We had been at the restaurant for around an hour, and I told my friend I needed to get going because I had an early day at work the next day. My friend said the bill was on him and he looked around for our waiter. We got the guys attention and he came over to us.  My friend though he should have been over to us sooner, I guess, because he said something about the guy having swum the river to get to the us faster than he got us our bill.  I think my jaw must have hit the table. I was completely shocked and couldn't believe such nasty words had come out of my friends mouth.  The waiter just left the bill and walked off. I was so embarrassed. My husband is Mexican and I had no idea my friend had just racist thoughts.  I paid the bill instead and left the waiter a huge tip.  I know that cant make up for such racism but I felt I had to do something.  I walked out with my friend and I could feel my face still flaming from anger and embarrassment mental at his words. I told him before I left the parking lot that what he had said was uncalled for and racist. He looked at me like I was in the wrong. We havent spoken since.] =",imagined, re,recalled

            [Three months ago, I went camping and kayaking down a river with the family. We got there and set up camp. We put up a blue tent. It was very tall. We soon got the kayak and went kayaking. We had a fun time for a little bit. In the middle of the kayaking, we tipped over. We almost drowned. We were lucky that some people were passing and saved us. We each gave each other a big hug. We decided to leave that place after that ordeal. We went home to lay in our beds. This was a taxing event for all of us. I hope we can all recover from this terrible near tragedy. I will definitely remember it as long as I live.] =",imagined, imag,imagined

He had some type of sickness that greatly impacted some of the things he did. about 5 months ago we had taken him to the doctor to get a check up. we just wanted to know what was wrong with our son. it took almost all day during that one appointment. The doctors finally told us about the what our son was diagnosed with. once they told me I just couldn't come to the acceptance of my son having this issue. I didnt wan't to face the truth of what was going on because it was hard. luckily my husband was there for me being able to calm me and guide me thoughout this problem. I really loved being with him because of his great support. I can get through almost anything with him and I love it. Eventually I just had to stop making things worse for myself. I knew I had to accept what was going on. The issues my son was having really took a toll on me. At the end I did prevail and was able to get my thoughts back together. I had to be in the best place to help my son.] =",imagined, imag,imagined

In the ad they said anyone could do it and that was all I needed to get started. I don't know why Harry won't listen to me. He's not the one who has to manage the finances. The kids need new back-to-school clothes and we really need something extra coming in. The whole thing is really simple. I demonstrate Miracle Health to people, they buy it and we make money. Even Harry could do it. And when anyone signs up under me I get a commission for everything they sell. It's just so perfect for us. If I could only get that couch potato to turn off the TV just once to pay attention to me. I never ask for anything for myself, you would think just once he would cooperate and do this for the family. I've tried everything I could think of to try and get it through his thick skull.

            [I had been unhappy with my job for over a year at that point. I had frequently thought about quitting but it was hard to find time to look for a new job with all of the responsibilites I had. I thought that I could find a better job. And I thought that I deserved better pay and more time off. Still I found it hard to actually apply for other jobs and go on interviews while doing my current job, doing housework, and exercising. I would get worked up and think that this was the end for me, that I was going to leave very soon. But then I would ease back into my job and take comfort in the familiarity of it. I liked the people I work with and didn't really want to leave them. Finally though I knew that I needed to leave. I started looking at job postings online. I wasn't sure where to begin really and worried that I was wasting my time writing cover letters to a bunch of companies that may not even look at it. After applying to what seemed like 50 jobs I had a few interviews and eventually offers from two of them. I was happy to recieve job offers and at least know that I could leave my job if I wanted to. One of the offers was for slightly more money, but it offered 5 weeks of vacation. I value money and need money just in order to make my life easier, but I had never even considered how I could use that time off. At my old job I got 2 weeks of vacation and some years never even used all of it. Having 5 weeks of vacation seemed incredible and seemed like it would drastically lower my stress. I ended up taking the job. I was sad to elave behind my old coworkers and we promised to keep in touch, but I knew there was many of them that I wouldn't keep up with. I've met new firends on my job now and I'm starting to feel at home here. I think that I'll be really happy here and I wish that I would have left my old job sooner.] =",imagined, imag,imagined

            [About 3 months ago I was faced with a really hard decision. First off, I want to start off by saying I love my job. I love my coworkers, my duties, the environment I'm in. I couldn't think of a better place to work. Everything around me seemed pretty perfect. I was making good money, and having a good time while I was doing it. However, as they say, nothing lasts forever. Just when I thought things were finally settling in for me, I had a run in with my manager that left me questioning everything. I never thought he would treat me the way he did that day. I remember coming home crying and feeling so embarrassed. I didn't even want to face my coworkers anymore after knowing they saw the way he had treated me. I didn't feel like showing up to work anymore, period! Later that day when I went home, I already began debating my future there. I knew my manager had treated other employees that way, but I just never thought it'd happen to me, since I always tried to be the best employee I could be. I felt so unappreciated and like I wouldn't even have a future there. I spent a long time deliberating, but ultimately, I decided it would be best for me to leave that place to avoid ever being treated like that again. I knew I deserved better.] =",imagined, imag,imagined

We went through Paris and the Omaha Beach where the D-Day landings happened. In Paris I enjoyed some sweets. I traveled through the countryside in Spain. It was surprising how laid-back people are in Spain. The pace of life is so much slower in Spain. People take there time during meals to have conversations. We saw but did not participate in the running of the bulls. It was excited and scary to see people trying to avoid those bulls. In Austria I enjoyed some Austrian chocolate. I enjoyed interacting with the locals. I had many interesting conversations with people. I love mountains. Austria is filled with many snow-capped mountains.

            [But I had to learn to use CPR and quick, as the elderly woman I had been caring for was on the floor having a seizure.  I was not used to caring for elderly patients either but somehow I got stuck with this useless hag after she was brought into our emergency unit after she had her first seizure. I had been a nurse for thirteen years and I didn't sign up for this shit. I was used to caring for younger, healthier patients that could perform basic tasks like wiping their own ass and bathing.  Even the cripple down the hall in a wheelchair is easier to take care of than this useless old bag as even he could wipe his own ass.  But nevertheless as I was getting ready to administer drugs to a patient in psych I was called to the emergency room because an old bag had a seizure and was now flopping around like a fish on her gurney that the EMT'S had strapped her onto.  They asked me to give her CPR and I asked if there wasn't anyone else around?  They said no all the nurses were busy in psych so for the first time ever I had to give an elderly woman mouth to mouth. I took a big gulp and took a long sip of water.  I wasn't mentally prepared for what I was about to do.  I closed my eyes and tried to picture the elderly woman was a more attractive younger, man.  My lips met hers and I nearly gagged as I was literally giving her mouth to mouth. I kept blowing into her mouth until finally she started coughing into my mouth and I jolted back in disgust.  The old bag had woken up and stopped shaking all over the place. Completely disgusted with what I had just done I immediately lifted her up and put her on a different gurney and was on my way to the elevator to bring her to psych when the EMT asked why I was going to bring her to the psych ward and not general care.  I lied and said we had no beds left and I really wanted to dump her off onto someone else and make her someone else's problem.  So I brought her up to psych and sedated her as she started talking non stop about her son and how he never calls her anymore.  I injected her with a large dose of oxycontin and she was out like a light.  I came back later to check on her and she wouldn't wake up.  I checked for a pulse and nothing.  She was stiff, dead as a door nail.  I panicked because I realized I had drugged her to the point where she must have died in her sleep.  I didn't know what to do, I didn't want to go to jail and I had been fired from three previous jobs for neglect. Then I remembered something, we had a patient with down syndrome who could barely spell his own name, let alone be able to tell what was going on.  So I sounded the alarm for a ""code red"" and blamed Timothy the guy with down syndrome for the elderly woman's death, I said he must have choked her while I was out changing bed pans. Timothy was sent to his room and doctor's were on their way up] =",imagined, imag,imagined

I feel like there is a truck sitting on my chest.  I want to get out of bed and live my life to the fullest, but it feels like it takes all of my energy just to get in the shower.  Maybe if I talk to someone it will help to get me out of this depression, but that feels so hard too.

In the summer, it is a refreshing spot to swim and play water sports. This summer we took the R.V. up to our favorite spot by the lake. Joining me for the trip was my wife, my two kids, and my six grandchildren. It was a really tight squeeze driving there. After we set up the campsite and put up the tents, we decided to go swimming in the lake. It was a fun day with the family and we celebrated with hotdogs and hamburgers for dinner. Later at night, we roasted marsh-mellows and made s'mores. The next day we woke up early and decided to go for a hike around the lake. When noon came along, it started to get pretty hot. I found my self overheating and I needed a little rest. My family brought over cold rags to place on my head in order to cool me down. It really helped!

Through it all I have the love of my life, my darling Charlene, to thank for her care and understanding. If you've never experienced what I have you probably won't understand but she was there when it happened, she was the one who insisted that I go to the hospital and it was her who cared enough to stay by my side night after night when things took a turn for the worse. It wasn't the surgery that laid me up but the complications caused by a negligent hospital staff and it was Charlene who rode their tails and saw to it that I received the follow up care I needed when things went side ways. So there I was, sitting on the sofa with my girl. We watching a movie on Netflix. I felt a stabbing pain in my back. Then I blacked out but it felt like I had just nodded off for a second. I woke up when Charlene started shaking me. She was upset. She knew before I did that things weren't right and before I could stop her she was already on the phone talking to my doctor. Next thing I know I'm in an ambulance racing through traffic with sirens blasting and lights flashing. They took me straight into the operating room and I woke up a few hours later with a 9 inch incision on my side where my spleen should have been. The first sign that something wasn't right was when I started trembling. I thought it was just a  chill but Charlene knew better. Turns out she knew better than all the nurses and doctors because what mhad been written off as a minor infection turned out to be meningitis without Charlene's insisting on the hospital doing further tests I wouldn't be here today. Thank you Charlene. I love, love, love you!!] =",imagined, imag,imagined

            [My family and I traveled to our son's school downstate to attend his graduation ceremony from Corpsman School 5 months ago. This was a proud moment for our family, and it was a long journey to get here for our family. It was culmination of years of hard work and dedication from my son and support from us that got him here. I could not have been proud of him if I tried.  So, to make sure we were there to see our son's achievement live, my wife and i took five days off work to ensure that we would be there and to account for any unexpected events. My wife and I would soon find out how useful those extra days would be. First, the rip to the school grounds went a lot slower than we anticipated due to flooding and storms in the area a few days prior. This made road leading downstate to be backed up with traffic and filled with detours that took longer routes. While annoying, the commute was the least for the issues as we would should learn later. Once arriving at the school grounds, we greeted our son and talked to him before we headed to our hotel were we would be staying for two days. When we got to our hotel, we discovered that the hotel was nearly as clean and neat as they advertised.  We weren't pleases, but we were tough old birds and tolerated it. On the day of the graduation ceremony, one last time had to present itself to make this trip as much of a headache as possible. We woke up late because the alarm clock in our room didn't work. So, when we left out to go to the school to be seated, we were already a half-hour. that half-hour made all the difference since finding a parking spot in the school's parking lot was a huge pain. We spent a good 20 minutes trying to a spot--any spot!--to park. By the time we finally found a spot, we only had 10 minutes to get into the building where the ceremony was being held before it started. Thankfully, I remembered were our seating was since I scooted the place with my son the day prior, so we were able to find our seating literally moment before the ceremony started.] =",imagined, re,recalled

This is true for everyone except rebecca. Rebecca graduated in our class, but decided to go full anarchy mode and always talk about the man and how were all cogs in the machine. She blogs as a profession however really doesnt make anything more than rent money from it. She also has no filter and doesnt seem to care about our group any more outside of just having something to do. However about 2 months ago we saw a shift. Troy sat down with her and really started asking her questions. Like what her passions were and what she wanted out of life. She admit that she was a bit lost and the idea of a stable job is just overwhelming and thats why she harps on everyone else. It was really cool to see her open up as we all thought she was just stuck in a rebellious phase. Troy had an opening at his company for some manual work and offered to get her set up with an interview. She said she would consider it but was a bit apprehensive. From going to staying at home all day to 8 hours in a warehouse seemed a bit of an abrupt change. overall we gained more respect for troy and rebecca that night.] =",imagined, imag,imagined

            [There is this girl I fell in love with when we both were kids. She was my first real love. I hadn't been in love before I met her but we instantly connected. She was very sweet, generous, compassionate and always helpful. I remember back when we met, she would bring me sweets from her house and we would share chocolate and ice cream. I fell in love with her since I was 7 years old and although we were kids and didn't understand much about love, there was this feeling that we belonged together. When we were applying for high school, we chose the same schools and we got accepted at the same high school. We started officially dating during our second year of high school. We had clearly been in love ever since we met but didn't know what love means until then. Our dating life was very gratifying. We were best friends and always inseparable. We kept each other's secret and always had each other's back. Unfortunately, when we left for college, we couldn't continue our relationship long distance and ended up breaking up. She married someone else after college and I married another woman as well. Four months, I got informed that she had been diagnosed with cancer and a few weeks after i learned that, I received the worst news I have ever received that she had passed away. I still haven't gotten used to this world not having her in it. She was the most beautiful soul and I haven't experienced any happiness since her passing.] =",imagined, imag,imagined

            [I was really nervous, as I am not great with speaking in front of others. My sadness had overtaken my nervousness and I had tried my best to remain composed while reading. When I saw the look on my grandmas and dad's face, I instantly started crying. In this moment I knew that I was never going to see my grandpa again. It is as if it hit me all at once right there in front of everyone-- he's really gone. Who is going to read my kids their Christmas books on Christmas eve? Who is going to joke about how much food we made for Easter? A thousand thoughts had come to my mind all at once and I felt overwhelmed. I am still trying to get passed the fact that he is gone forever. I am not sure how I will ever accept that but I am trying hard everyday. It's been such a sadness I couldn't describe, I wasn't ready to see him like that at his funeral. I can't get the image out of my mind, I just want to remember his smiling happy face instead of what I saw at his funeral-- cold and just not ""grandpa"". As much as I had tried to make the tribute into something beautiful and happy, I don't think it mattered because we all knew he was gone. I enjoyed the fact that the service was non traditional-- he had an exceptional personality that definitely was not traditional. Overall, I am extremely sad about him being gone but am trying my hardest to move past the sadness I feel everyday.] =",imagined, imag,imagined

A lot has happened over the years, and our relationship has been strained, but I think things are finally turning around. We've been spending a lot more time together, and talking fairly regularly. One of the areas of our relationship that I am working on improving is understanding her better. She used to complain that I didn't know much about her, or what she is into. Right before our big fight a few years ago, she complained that I've never bought her a custom gift, only thoughtless store-bought gifts. She didn't know this, but that day, I ordered a custom walking stick for her, since she loves hiking. I thought it would be perfect for her. Before the walking stick arrived though, she and I had a huge argument and she told me not to contact her. I couldn't bring myself to return the walking stick, so when it arrived, I kept it in its original box and kept it stored away, in case things ever worked out. A few months ago, I ran into her at a coffee shop and we talked for a few minutes. It went well, and we've been regularly texting and calling each other since then. We've visited each other a few times, and we both feel that the relationship is restored and back to normal. I went to her house for Christmas, and I decided to gift her with the walking stick. She loves it, and she's already sent me photos of her using it. She said it's perfect for her. She invited me to go hiking with her next weekend, and I am really looking forward to it.] =",imagined, imag,imagined

            [Going home from the bank is usually a mundane, uneventful occurrence. Three months ago, however, it was anything but. I rode my bike to the bank in order to deposit a check. That in itself went smoothly. While cycling back home to the bank, however, my route so happened to weave through a path where rowdy kids were playing. I did not plan ahead and did not think of an alternative route to cycle through, so I had no choice but to go past them. They partook in a match of paintball. As they were playing, I got hit in the shoulder by one of the paintball capsules. I was super mad at the children, and was tempted to yell at them. I just wanted to get home above all, though, so instead of adding to the conflict I instead made sure to bike much faster until I knew for sure I was completely out of the kids sights. During the rest of my ride, my mind had two focuses. One was getting home, the other was how annoyed I was at it happening to me. I showered just before going to the bank, and now I'll have to shower again! But it could've been worse. At the very least, I wasn't hurt that badly. I was not knocked off my bike, which spared me from potential worse injuries. Since this happened, I've made sure to have multiple cycling routes to prevent something like this from happening again.] =",imagined, imag,imagined

            [Today, my sister and I found some feral kittens in the forest behind our house.  We were hanging out on the back porch and my sister heard the faint sound of something crying.  It was a good distance, but it kept crying, so we went and checked it out.  A little into the forest, and under a tree we found a group of 3 kittens, but the mother was not in sight.  We spent the better part of the day waiting to see if the mother would return.  When she didn't we decided to take them and try to find homes for them. We went down the street, door-to-door, asking if anyone wanted the kittens.  There were a few that did, but my sister and I got some bad feelings about the first few people.  We felt that they were going to be mean to their kittens, and two of the people had big dogs too.  One of the last we asked tried to forcefully take the kittens out of our hands, but we managed to get away.  In the end, we were able to find a home for all three kittens.  They were given to a nice older lady who had multiple  cats already and a larger farm to let them come and go as they pleased.  The older lady, also said we could come back and visit anytime we wanted.  I think that the kittens will be very happy.

            [We enjoyed thoroughly the entire event. It can be fun to get out of our comfort zone in a brand new activity. However, starting with one we already know and love will give. Make a quick list of the activities we are most comfortable with. Need some good ideas first. Take a look at our list of fun ways to meet new friends in a new city as well as ways to meet friends online. Personally I love the immersion dating nature of the show, not to mention how addictive it is to watch, and think we should all try it at some point. It is viscerally impossible not to like someone who genuinely smiles at you. This means smiling with our entire face, including our eyes. Try this as to greet friends and colleagues and observe their reaction. A smile will disarm defenses, boost your likability and increase the chances of a positive conversation before you say a word. Every time smile makes us start a good relationship. At last had a good partner. ItâÃÃ´s time to get super clear on what you love to do. Because when you pursue hobbies and activities you enjoy, you have a good chance of meeting people with similar interests. When youâÃÃ´re just starting to get to know someone, foster intimacy by talking about something deeper than the suck weather. Gradually disclose something meaningful about yourself and see if your new friend will do the same. While not everyone has the courage to do it, most of us know how to pursue a crush. Swipe right. Send flowers to their office. Invite them to a concert of a band you know theyâÃÃ´ll love. Ask them to check yes or no under the question Will you go out with me? on lined paper. Apply similar tactics when pursuing a potential friend. For example, send the person an email asking them to lunch or coffee next week, and follow up afterward to say you had a good time and mention something specific that was funny or memorable.] =",imagined, imag,imagined

Both of them love being active and very much enjoy nature. I've always being an outdoorsy person, too. As a young child, I played many sports and you could always find me playing outside! I had a tetherball set up in my backyard, lots of roller skates, bikes and scooters. I loved going hiking, taking my sister to the park, taking our dog for a walk and so many other activities that involved enjoying the outdoors. My love for the outdoors continued passed my childhood. Once I had my daughter, a lot of her activities took place outside the house. I definitely think I passed on the love for the outdoors to my daughter. About six weeks ago, my daughter and her husband took a road trip out to Texas. They decided to forgo Thanksgiving plans and instead go camping. They had told me of their plans and I was super excited for them. I wanted to join but I had already committed to a Thanksgiving dinner party. On Thanksgiving day, I get a frantic call from my daughter. She tells me she is bleeding quite a bit and she had missed her period for a few months. I told her to try to relax and suggested she call her doctor. She cut the camping trip short and returned home promptly. The bleeding continued but it had subsided a lot. She had an appointment a couple of days after Thanksgiving and a blood test revealed she was pregnant. She returned to the doctor a couple of weeks later and to our surprise, the ultrasound showed not one but two kids!] =",imagined, imag,imagined

We loaded up our tent and supplies into my little car and set out for the ocean! We got to our campsite  on the beach after dark. It was pretty funny watching us try to set up our tent in the pitch black! We finally got our bonfire started and roasted hot dogs over the fire for dinner. When we woke the next morning, my friend John asked if we wanted to go splunking. I hated to admit it but I had no idea what he was talking about! Luckily, he started explaining that it's cave exploring before I had to ask. We were all game so we hopped in the car with our flashlights and took off for the nearby caves. When we entered the cave I was really having second thoughts...what if we get lost in here? it was dark, damp and I kept feeling like I was being watched!! One by one my friends in front of me squeezed through a narrow hole to go deeper into the cave. When it was my turn, I got the top part of my body through just fine but my hips were too large and I literally got stuck!!! I started to panic! The more I twisted and squirmed to get loose the more I got stuck!!! My friends were laughing at first, but after about 30 minutes they soon realized I was literally stuck!  My friend Sarah had some coconut oil sunscreen with her and spread it in any crack she could find around my hips. after that one good tug and I popped right out of there!! I think it's safe to say splunking is not what I though it would be, and I doubt I will ever do it again after that!!!] =",imagined, imag,imagined

They had all the old tools and machinery commonly seen around settler homes back then. They were doing ordinary daily chores like scrubbing clothes. We even got to see a settler churning real butter from cream. Then there were the animals. I think this was my favorite part.

At first I though something in the water had bit me. Or maybe it had just been a pool toy. But then I looked up and saw old and disgusting Larry with this sick grin on his face and his hand still near my thighs. I gasped and kicked away, ignoring my fear of deep water and swam as fast as I could. When I kicked away, I got some satisfaction when I felt my left foot slam into the side of Scary Larry's head.

We left in the late afternoon to check into our hotel to visit the wineries early the next day when they opened.  On the drive there we took a detour to stop at Sleeping Bear Dunes.  William is a hobby photographer and really wanted to see a sunset from this vantage point.  It was a trek to the best location but it was amazingly worth it.  I think we were all ready to a good nights rest after the travel and hiking that day.  The wineries the next day were equally amazing and we learned a lot about the wines are made.  At least a couple of us enjoyed ourselves a little too much so it was a great idea that we'd decided to Uber from the hotel and back again.  They have some amazing restaurants in TC so after we had a couple hours to recover we took them to out favorite spot in town.  It was pretty busy for being the middle of the summer so we had to wait a little bit, but it was worth it.  They specialize in locally grown and sourced foods and really care about the quality and presentation.  We were happy our friends could experience this on their first trip to the states.      With only a few days of their trip left we took them up to Mackinaw Island for a day trip to experience what it's like to ride in a horse drawn carriage, and to ride on bikes to get where you need to go.  We had so much visiting all of the charming shops and taking in the scenery.  We were fortunate we had gorgeous weather that wasn't too hot for June.       We had such an amazing time visiting with out Irish friends that we're already talking about finding away to visit them in Ireland before they potentially end up moving to the states.    We're fortunate they were able to visit us in the summer when our state really shines!  Maybe we'll take them skiing in December if William ends up getting that transfer.] =",imagined, imag,imagined

            [Five weeks ago, we arrived in Chicago on a Sunday. From our hotel room this city spread out before us like a jewel. We walked along Lake Michigan and looked at the Azure water. We felt the warm breeze coming off the Lake. Sailboats cruised in the distance. We went to the Chicago Museum of Art. They had a large exhibition of folk art, which we enjoyed. They even had some van Goghs. We stayed there for hours, enjoying the beauty of creation. We then went to the Magnificent Mile. We enjoyed all the departments stores. We spent too much money but we had a lot of fun. As we walked back to the hotel along Lake Michigan. We saw big storm roiling the lakes waters. Though it was only 3:30 in the afternoon, it became as dark as midnight. A huge gust blew on me. I try to keep my balance, but I was thrown right into the waters of the Lake.  The water was deeper than I was tall. I flailed and splashed around. Suddenly, a man in an orange vest appeared next to me. He put his arm around me and pushed me up where another man grabbed me. An EMS Scooter took me to a warm room where I was given some hot soup.  What a surprising turn for my trip to take!] =",imagined, imag,imagined

            [Two months ago we took a family beach vacation for about a week. We were in Florida, the sun shining above us, the heat of the sun on our backs. It was beautiful. We had a free week of any work and school for the kids between the 16 and 23 of July, and it was an amazing opportunity we couldn't pass up. Our kids were distracted by the sand and the water. Me and my husband were calm and relieved for the first time in God knows how long. We actually enjoyed ourselves. I remember my daughter found a full sand dollar and showed it off to us, and I was shocked. I had never seen a complete one in my life, only pieces. My husband pretended to care, but I knew he was dozing off on his fold out chair while trying to maintain a conversation with out excited daughter. I held up the conversation for him, sparing him it. He deserved to rest. This year had been incredibly busy for him, and he just needed a break. I for one had fun playing with the kids in the water. I was really in touch with my inner child on that vacation.] =",imagined, imag,imagined

            [Life has changed so much in the past week. Kallie was born and thankfully is doing really well. We had our doubts about everything due to how much went wrong. It started earlier that day, my wife had contractions that were strong and a few minutes apart. It seemed really sudden, but this was our first daughter so we had no idea what to expect. We go to the hospital as soon as we could and she gets taken to a room. I am left to fill out paperwork and make sure that my doctor knows what is going on. I get to go to the room after everyone is settled in and my wife's blood pressure starts going up really high. I call the nurse and she comes in and the doctors come in and soon they are saying they need to dilate her faster. I have no idea what is going on! They end up rushing her to the labor and delivery room and I think that this is it. I had no idea all of the rushing wasn't normal! I just thought this was how it was! I called our parents and family and told them about the baby was coming. The doctor came and told me that they were having to do a C-Section on my wife. I had no idea what they meant, but he explained that there were some issues with the cord and the baby and that was the safest way to get the baby out. After hours of waiting, I was able to see my wife and Kallie. I am just grateful everyone is fine.

            [I remember the day like it was yesterday. It was a horrible day that I will never forget. I still have nightmares about it to this day. Two months ago I was in my room playing video games. It was a typical day and I was home along in my house. My dad would be coming home any minute now. We had recently gotten a new dog and my old dog and her go along just fine or that what we originally thought. However, on that day I heard growling and then a loud yelping noise. I pause my game and run down the stairs as fast as possible. My dogs got into a huge fight and one had the other one by the neck and was trying to kill her. I rushed over there and pulled them apart the best I could. The small dog had puncture wounds all over and had heavy bleeding. Thankfully my dad walked right in the door and took control of it. I knew how to solve the issue but was not ready to take control. He sprung into action telling me the things he would need to help my dog. I grabbed all of the supplies for him and he started washing and stitching my dog up. I was very lucky that he is a veterinarian and that he was able to save my dog. Now we keep both dogs separate but I will never forget that fateful day.] =",imagined, imag,imagined

            [It was so hard when my son left home to start his new job.  I had been through this experience myself when I left home years ago. My father was so broken up and I was afraid that I would do the same.  In my mind I imagined giving the boy meaningful advice and having a big moment. I thought of all the things I could say and do to make the moment right. But when the time came, all I could do is a give a hug and not speak a word.  Ever since this happened four months ago I still think about it.  This was supposed to be a big moment.  Something that my son would remember as he went through his life.  I wanted to arm him with advice that he could take and propel himself forward with.  I wanted to have a moment like you see on TV.  But alas, seeing him off didn't go that way.  At certain times, thinking about this event even makes me feel weak.  However, as more time passes I realize that this moment was great in its own right.  I didn't have the words that I wanted to say, but I've never been great at these moments.  My son could tell how emotional I was, and knows how proud I am all the same. Our actions mean more than words and my love was on display that day.  I also remind myself, that no matter the advice I could have given, everyone needs to learn for themselves and my son will be just fine doing the same.] =",imagined, imag,imagined

            [One month ago I was lucky enough to be the officiant for my best friend's wedding. What an honor that was! I felt very blessed to be such an integral part of their special day. It was a beautiful summer wedding and I'm glad it was my first. It was such a lovely experience, but two moments in particular stick out to me. The first is when my best friend, the bride, walked down the aisle. She was stunning! She had her dark hair in an intricate up-do and perfectly done makeup. Her dress was sleeveless, had lots of perfectly placed lace, and fit her like it made especially for me. It was almost as if she walked straight out of a bridal magazine! The groom's expression was so wholesome. He had tears in his eyes and I heard him clear his throat a few times. I got choked up too, seeing him being so in love with my best friend. The second moment was when they exchanged their vows. They chose to write their own. Neither were big writers, but both wrote some of the most beautiful words I have ever heard. Their love for each other really showed. It was hard to keep my composure as the officiant because the moment was so breathtaking. When she asked me to do this, I did not realize how important this moment would feel to me. I simply thought I would be doing them a favor, but it was so much more than that. I was able to join my best friend and the love of her life together in holy matrimony. This is a day I will never forget and will cherish forever.] =",imagined, imag,imagined

I am older than her, though we are very close in age. We were only one grade apart in school. I took care of her when mom and dad couldn't. I looked after her and saved her from bullies in school. Things changed a bit after school. I left home, went to college, and because of this I moved pretty far away. I don't see her as much as I used to. I miss her so dearly and I know that she misses me. I still go to see her as often as I can, and when I do, we always do something fun. I know that she is sick, but she doesn't see it that way. She is so courageous.

And I had gotten the opportunity to see him before he passed. So the day was bitter sweet. Marcy came home and she was so scared but excited.

            [Let me tell you a story about a road trip i made with my aunt 3 weeks ago. My aunt and i decided to do a little traveling and considered how we would do this. we thought about taking a train but that would have been a limiting factor if we wanted to make a stop here and there. so Judy (who is my aunt of course) said ""Lets take a road trip instead! it would be fun"" and of course i agreed and off we went. Thought out the course of 8 days we did a ton of sight seeing as well as hiking and some swimming! We stayed at a few 5 star hotels but we rather sleep under the stars so we would set up some tents and star gaze looking for the famous fast streaks in the sky that shooting stars often leave. But the best part of this story is the friends and family we stopped to visit! the first stop we made was at my friends Rudy's house and with out notice because we wanted to to be a surprise. Well guess what? The surprise was on us! Rudy (who is a long time friend Judy and i) was getting married! And was throwing a party that night (we were dipping into the punch bowl more then once might i add) but that's not the exciting part, he is getting married to my sister! No one told me about it because they wanted it to be a surprise using this magical road trip i went on.  so in the following days Judy and i continued to stop at some more friends houses before we attended the wedding. Let me tell, you it was the most amazing wedding i ever attended. we threw more rice that day then we could of possibly eaten in a year. At the reception, we danced till we dropped an let me tell you my legs were soooo sore the next day i could of stayed in bed for a week! Judy and i had an absolute blast at the wedding and a day to remember for the rest of our lives. In conclusion Judy an i do plan on another road trip but that is all i will say for now but you will want to tune in for that trip because we plan on something very special!] =",imagined, imag,imagined

It's so much better for my health because of the diseases I had. I won't suffer anymore as I used to. The surgery itself was tough, but after recovery I will feel much better. I'm sad in some ways that this ended up happening, but I'm glad I found a doctor who was able to help me. Life can still go on and I will bounce back from this. I am grateful I was able to finally come to a resolution with my health and move on. I can look forward to being out of pain and suffering now. In the long run, quality of life is what is most important so I can enjoy my days. I know this won't make me any less of a woman. I've always been scared of surgery, but I got through it!

            [It's been a really long few months since I lost my job. I have been searching and looking for a new one every day, but it's a tough market out there. Everybody wants a better job, everybody wants and needs more money, and the competition is stiff. The savings that we have is quickly depleting and there isn't much left after this month. I've been depressed and my anxiety is through the roof lately. I need to be able to put food on the table for my kids, and keep a roof over their heads. A few weeks ago I was searching online for what I could possibly do from home at least for something, anything. Any help at this point would be amazing. Extra groceries, phone bill, electric bill, I don't care, it all needs to be paid anyway. I found some sites that seemed like I could do surveys for some cash, but most paid in gift cards, and you seem to need weeks worth of points to be able to earn a gift card. Then I found Mechanical Turk. It's something Amazon controls, so I looked into it and decided to sign up. It was a few days for me to get my approval, and in which time I did some research to find out what kind of jobs I could expect. The answer to that, was a little bit of everything, and sometimes some seriously crazy stuff. I read stories of some of the crazy things people did. By the time I got my approval, I felt fairly ready to jump right in and hopefully start making some money. The first few days to a week were rough, there aren't many jobs available for a new worker, so I worked for literal pennies an hour. But it got my feet wet. After the first few weeks I started getting into the swing of things, and luckily I've been making some better money. This week alone I've made enough for groceries at least. Is it long tedious hours some days? Yep. But you know what? It doesn't matter, because this is only for the short term until I find something else, and at least my kids are being fed. Not being able to afford the basics really does a number to your self-esteem.] =",imagined, imag,imagined

She started crying and asking for my forgiveness. While continuing crying, she apologized for all of the things that she did to me. I was starting to get embarrassed as other people were looking over at our table. Awhile ago I had said that I would never forgive her for the constant insults and verbal abuse that she hurled at me over the years. But in that moment, I saw the sincerity and remorse in her eyes. She wanted to try to fix the things that she had done. I accepted her apology and we had started the first step in rebuilding our relationship.

            [Today I was thinking back to mom's birthday. It was about five weeks ago now, but it still brings a smile to my face when I think about it.  I still can't believe that we pulled off the surprise party! Things got a little sketchy when she said she wan't really feeling like going  out to dinner, but they came full circle when I worked my puppy dog eye magic and she went any way. I still got it. When we got to our usual restaurant we walked in as usual but the hostess said they were expecting a large party so we'd have to sit in the back side of the restaurant. When we turned the corner - BAM - there was the whole family, just for mom! It was awesome to see the love that we all have for her and for her to be the star of the show for once. Her face was glowing and so were ours. We spent hours together at the restaurant with everyone that we love and then they brought the cake out... mom's favorite too. Ice cream cake! That's when the tears started flowing. She whispered in my ear that she never had a party for herself. She was always the one throwing parties. So needless to stay the tears poured down my face right along with her. Man do I love this woman. I can only hope to be half the woman she is.] =",imagined, imag,imagined

            [This year I decided that I wanted to start more to help those less fortunate than me. Around Christmas time I started to really notice how many people were struggling around me. I knew it happened, but somehow I never really thought too much about it. About 2 weeks ago now, I was walking down the road on my way to get a cup of coffee before doing some Christmas shopping and I saw a bunch of businesses with people curled up outside them. Trying to keep themselves warm with blankets, sleeping bags and hats. Those were the lucky ones. I saw ones that were just huddled up inside doorways doing their best to stay warm and alive with empty cups in front of them, or signs. Just begging people to help them out with the basic needs that every human being needs and deserves. I don't know what it was that made me notice today of all days. Maybe because I was out spending too much money on Christmas presents that really weren't that needed when there are people who can't even afford a hot meal. I spotted one guy sitting there with just a small blanket, though he wasn't using the blanket, the blanket was curled around a small dog, who looked as though he had seen better days. I dug into my pockets and checked what I had for cash, and it wasn't much. I stopped to talk to him, and learned he had been laid off 2 years ago and lost his home and has no family near by. I talked to him for a bit learning that he found the dog abandoned one day and decided to keep him. His money that he gets from panhandling goes to feeding his dog, who is his best friend. I asked him if he was hungry and he looked at me quite surprised and said he was starving, he was lucky to eat at all each day. He asked a friend of his a few feet away to watch his dog, and off we went to get some lunch. I picked up some sandwiches for the others that I spotted and some hot cups of coffee, and of course a bag of dog food for his buddy. We delivered the food, and I've never seen such joy before. It was a good moment, I made a lot of people happy, but most of all, I made myself happy.] =",imagined, imag,imagined

            [Taking the morning off of work to go and see a bear in my friend's basement. Yes, he really did have a bear in his basement. At first, I don't know why he has this and even this is allowed to be in here. I didn't know how to react to this bear because I didn't expect it to be there at all. I had so much questions to my friend on why he has this bear in the first place. When I got there, I was in complete shock because it is bigger than I expected. This is a beautiful creature and I would like to pet it but I was scared. I talked to him about the bear and asked what is he going to do with it. He said hes going to keep it but I don't know how I feel about that. So I suggested that he should let him out of the wild because bears are not pets. We fought throughout the whole which got me really frustrated because I have no idea why would he keep it at all. I know that these are not meant to stay here and it should out there. I told him that I would take action if he doesn't let this bear free. At the end of the day, he told me I was right and we let him go. I knew he wanted to keep him but I know that its better for the bear more than him. We have to think about the bears happiness to not just my friend.] =",imagined, imag,imagined

            [It is a policy at work that no one should be caught watching sexual or pornographic materials on work computers. Recently, I caught a coworker  watching pornographic clips on his work computer. I noticed that the coworker was late in presenting his work to our group and went to ask why. When I arrived at his desk he was busy watching pornographic videos. I had to bang his desk to notify him that I was around. I asked politely about the report and that is when he started shouting at me. This alerted the supervisor who came fast and found the coworker still talking to me. The video clips were playing on his work computer all along. The supervisor took the case to management and the coworker was relived of his duties immediately. After a week, the coworker was rehired after he threatened to sue the company. The company fearing on the bad image the story might bring, they hired him back. Funny enough, he was given a managerial position, a position I should have been promoted to. Because the company had already promoted one person to the managerial position, I was forced to wait for another year to see whether I can be promoted. I wonder how is this even possible. Someone who should be terminated is now literally my boss. I do not know how I am going to submit reports to him knowing I was technically the reason he got fired. I feel like resigning. This world can be unfair.] =",imagined, imag,imagined

            [Three months ago, my old faithful friend, Arwen was unable to get up out of her bed.  She had lived a very active, long life.  We spent our free time going to the park and hiking along the shady paths along the lake.  For sixteen years, we had been inseparable, enjoying weekend excursions.  She loved to run along the quiet paths where we hiked.  She would bark at butterflies and chase falling leaves! I knew she loved the outdoors, so I helped her and carried her outside to lay on her favorite cushion on our sunny deck to take in the morning breeze.  She wagged her tail and laid her tired head on my kneee as I sat beside her.  She did not want to eat anything that I offered.  I had called before we went outside and had an appointment at her vet.  I carried her to the car and placed her on her favorite blanket.  I knew that she would not be coming home again, and I wanted this to be as easy on her as possible.  Although it made me sad to say goodbye, I knew it was time for her suffering to be over.  Although this was a sad morning for me, I am so thankful that we had our time together. Arwen, I will never forget you!  You made a huge impact on my life!] =",imagined, imag,imagined

            [Two months ago I visited my good friend in Ormond Florida on the 4th of July. We use to date when we lived in the same city but now there is a a few hundred miles in between us. I've missed him so I wanted to take a quick weekend trip just to hang out. I ended up staying at his place on the beach which was amazing. Each morning we had breakfast at the local diner and then we would head to the beach to relax a bit. It was so nice just to be in his arms again and smell his cologne. The last night I was there was the best. He surprised me with dinner on the beach and the meal did not disappoint. He made fresh seafood pasta with Alfredo sauce, salad, and homemade rolls. We sipped on our favorite craft beer while we set at the little table he had set up. The most memorable part was the walk we took after supper along the shoreline. The tide was starting to come ashore and he stopped and gave me a gentle kiss. I was stunned when he pulled out a small box with a necklace inside. I was blown away by his kindness. I can't wait until we see each other again but I know it will be a few months.  I just hope we can both wait this distance out and one day be together. If it's meant to be then it will all work out.] =",imagined, imag,imagined

            [About a month ago my day had started out pretty normally at first. Though after receiving some bad news and going to work I found that I was in a rather bad mood. I tried to change my mood, but nothing was working. I spent the rest of the work day away from other people so I wouldn't get angry at them. After work I returned home to find that I needed some food. I thought that I could hop over to the nearby grocery store for some dinner. I drove over to the grocery store and found a parking spot in-between two other cars. I noticed the person to the left of me was also getting out of their car. We made involuntary eye contact, but we lingered longer than normal. That's when it hit both of us that we knew each other. We slowly both realized we were friends in high school who hadn't spoken in years. We started chatting on our way into the grocery store and soon found ourselves laughing at old memories. After each getting our different items at the store we left together. As we were in the process of getting into our cars we exchanged phone numbers. We promised to get in contact and have dinner or something. By the time that I was on my way home I was in a much better mood than before.] =",imagined, imag,imagined

            [About 5 months ago, Paul had gotten kicked out of my house because of an argument He had with his parents. He had saved up some money but he spent it on Christmas presents for his family and friends. He had been working part time for a warehouse near his house but it was closed for the season and he had been out of work for a few weeks. He had tried calling his CTE worker but he couldn't get a hold of them. He went to the bus station to get a ticket to go to where his sister lives, but the ticket was too expensive.  He had no family or friends in the immediate area, so he didn't know what to do. I had worked with him a little bit at the warehouse and he seemed like a nice enough person. I had given him a ride home from work a few times over the past few months. I gave him my phone number, so in case he needed a ride. He kept my number and gave me a call. he let me know what his situation was and that he was not sure what he should do. I told him I would drive down there to see him. When I got there he was just sitting on a bench in front of the station with his head hung low. I greeted him and he looked up at me. I asked what was going on and he said he had nowhere to go and no money so he was scared and worried that he would have to sleep out in the cold that night. I looked in my wallet and had ten dollars  in there, which I knew would get him a night at the local shelter a few miles away. I told him I could pay to get him into the shelter tonight. I told him I'd give him a ride down there so he wouldn't have to walk in the cold. He smiled and thanked me for my help. When we got to the shelter, I told him to give me a cll in the morning and I would see if I could find him some part-time work at the farm I worked on so he could try to get money for a bus ticket or somewhere more permanent to stay. He started crying and thanked me and gave me a big hug.] =",imagined, imag,imagined

            [Two months ago, my family came to a standstill in life. My mom received the worst news that any woman could receive from a doctor. Breast cancer. She was sick and could potentially die. I sat in the waiting room as my dad and mom sat in the doctor's office, hearing the news for the first time. Even two months later, I'm still processing it. Thankfully, from what I understand and my parents explained to me that night after returning home, it's in the early stages. There's a good possibility she could survive. That makes me happy. I don't know what I would do without her. They told me and my siblings that she would be starting chemotherapy, whatever that is, in about a week. They warned us that mommy may not look the same for a while, may not smile as much, may not play with us as much. Dad told us her long hair would probably fall out. I don't fully understand what all this means, but they've tried explaining it to me. I don't want my mom to die. This isn't really fair, is it? Why her? But I'll stay strong for my siblings, for my dad, and for my mom. I won't cry. She'll get better. You'll see.] =",imagined, imag,imagined

            [As I recall, the most exciting part of that month was the Inkarceration Festival in Ohio. I found myself again at Mansfield, after many years of struggling. Perhaps it was the location, or the people. Perhaps I was just getting over my breakup. All I know is, something wonderful happened there. The music we had practiced over and over this time put me in some sort of introspective trance. I felt like a different person. And that everything was going to be brighter in the future. I suppose everyone has these moments in life. These realizations where they feel that the road has just taken a turn for the better. The guys were there, doing what they normally do: rough housing, talking crap, lighting up to play cards in the back after the concert, or sometimes scouting the crowd for the easiest fan-girl. However, on this trip I felt more connected to them. I felt as though they were beginning to really understand me. Sometimes it would be just a look in the eye, or a nod here and there. Somehow I felt a part of the fold. That festival will always be a highlight of my new road. A masterfully crafted cobblestone compared to the briar-riddled swamp I was trudging through before.] =",imagined, imag,imagined

            [It is hard to believe how much has changed for me in the last 4 months. Veronica and I had dated since high school. I thought she was the woman I was going to marry. 4 months ago, totally out of the blue, she broke up with me. I was devastated. We did everything together. Not only was she my girl friend, but she was my best friend. I thought we had the perfect relationship. We liked the same things, we had the same friends, we could even finish each others sentences. When she broke up with me, I kept trying to figure out what was wrong with me. After the break up, I stayed in and didn't talk to anybody. I didn't want to go anywhere, or do anything. I fell in to a really deep depression. My mom finally convinced me to go see a therapist. Little did I know, that therapist would change my life. She made me realize how much I had to offer and that the break up was not because of me. I didn't see it at the time, but Veronica and I were just comfortable with one another, we were not soul mates. We had just been holding on to something because we were afraid to move on. I'm finished with my therapy and I feel better about myself than I have in a long time. As a matter of a fact, I'm going on a date next week and I haven't been this excited about anything in a long time. Several weeks after my therapy ended I realized that I could not get my therapist out of my mind. I called her up and asked her out and since I am no longer her patient, she said yes. I realize now, everything happens for a reason and it is time for me to move on.] =",imagined, imag,imagined

The doctor said I needed surgery but couldn't get it. It wasn't painful at the time, but it steadily grew more painful. Somehow, that was my key. I broke down one night and decided to get my weight in check. Soon, I started going to the gym. It was pretty scary at first, but the regulars there only encouraged me. It was wonderful, and they helped me get into a weight loss routine. I started jogging with them as well as use the treadmills. I actually made some fitness friends along the way. Mind you, I still needed this minor surgery to be done. I still felt it from time to time. I lost over 100 pounds in the course of a year and a half, and I was able to go back to my doctor. They seemed really impressed that I took initiative and I was able to get the surgery.] =",imagined, imag,imagined

I didnt quite understand, but Jane told me that Lucy's boyfriend garret got her involved with his ""church"". The church promotes well being through their lord of opportunity which only the worthy are saved. In order to prove worthiness you are to let your body deteriorate. You only eat when you are allotted food, which is about twice a week in meager portions. Bathing, cleaning, grooming are all strictly prohibited. Any contact with family or attempts to break free are temptations that the lord does not look kindly on. Jane went over to lucys house and said she had lost significant weight, looked unkempt, and the house was a mess. She was informed by garret that Lucy couldnt speak to family on grounds of initiation. She called the police bu they informed her that they cannot do anything as she is doing this of her own free will. I never knew such cults existed and don't know what to do now. Lucy was always so normal and has become something else because of garret. I can only hope that she will come to her senses and take care of herself.

We were best friends in high school and grew apart a little in college but still remained close. Then life happened. we both got full time jobs in different cities and that life thing kicked in. You know that part of being best friends is shared experiences and being able to remember them, talk about them and laugh. We had some great times when we were younger and hung out all the time, games, concerts ( the fight at ZZ top), and hunting. But, time moves on and people grow apart with distance, time,  and meeting other people. I know that is what happened to us. I feel really sad this happened because he was my best friend for almost 15 years. That being said, I know that we will keep in contact but it just wont be the same as it use to be. That makes me sad because Kreig was in my life for so long. I hope one day that we both can build a relationship as strong with someone else and be able to have those shared memories and laughs.

I really wish that the hospital would take into consideration of what I am going through.  My cancer seems to always be one step ahead of me.  Sometimes I wish that I could just end it all but then I think about my loved ones, children, and friends.  Life was  never meant to be easy but it seems that I always get the short end of the stick.  Thank goodness I have God in my life.  HE ensures my comfort and i know that without Him I would not have made it this far.  I pray every day and every night and give my thanks.  I realize all of my gifts that i have been granted in life.  even though my cancer is still prevalent in my life I know that all is good.  I hope that hospital realizes how they are impacting others lives.  Maybe had I received my chemo, my cancer could be in remission.  My breathing problems seem to have subsided but only slightly.  Hopefully when I go to my new doctor, they can whip me back into shape.  I heard great reviews about them and am anxious to get there.  God bless] =",imagined, imag,imagined

My brother and I were shocked, but we were aware he was seeing someone. We had been happy for him. He was nervous, telling us. Nervous we would hold contempt for him or anger. Quite the opposite, we were overjoyed. We had to compartmentalize as we were still mourning the loss of our mother, but it wouldn't be fair to not allow him to move on. He broke out in tears. We had never seen our dad cry, it caught us off-guard. He thanked us, profusely, for being okay with it. We told him we loved him and that mom would be happy he had found someone.

It took a couple days to get here and I was really worried that I was just wasting my time and money. Still my curiosity got the best of me and I decided to try it. It tasted awful, like seriously, the worst thing I have ever purposely drank. At first I really didn't see anything happening, other than excessive use of the bathroom. But after two or three days and around ten pound of bad stuff being removed from my body I began to believe it was actually working. It worked really well for like two weeks, and then it wasn't really doing anything anymore. This kind of disappointed me but I was determined to keep going, and keep getting my body healthier. So a month ago I started a different way, I started getting more sun, and eating more raw foods. I went on walks, and just tried to let my body detoxify as naturally as possible.  It helped a lot, After a week or so of that I began to lose weight and could feel myself becoming stronger. It has been a wild ride.

Instead of jitters and happiness, I just felt like I'm one year closer and closer to being old. In fact, I felt pretty old. Everyone around me kept assuring me how young I really am, and how I still have so much life left, yet I can't help but just feel like an old geezer. One thing happened that changed all that, though. I told my best friend that I wasn't too excited about my birthday and not to do anything too special for me. This was a huge mistake. My friend took this as a challenge, and although I didn't know it just yet, he was going to give me the best birthday party I've ever had. When the day arrived it was just like any day. I went to work, ate my daily breakfast, did everything I usually do. Then, when I got home, he, along with all of my other friends and even some family all shouted ""Surprise!"" as loud as they possibly could. I was in complete disbelief. We partied, hung out, talked, and had a wonderful time. He got me concert tickets to my favorite band. Maybe birthdays aren't so bad after all.] =",imagined, imag,imagined

            [I spoke with Derek again today and he's doing better. His cast comes off in another couple of days and he's excited to get to walk without crutches. The damn cast was a menace to society! There have been tons of times when he's swung that thing around and nearly tripped me. It's also riddled with dirty drawings scribbled in marker and jokes poking fun at him falling off a cliff. I still can't believe he took that tumble, but Derek likes to act fearless. I also think he might have been a little drunk, but I could never really be sure. The strangest part is that it was a cliff that we've climbed a hundred times before. I have no idea how he slipped in a way that propelled him off the cliff face and onto the ground below. That's why I think he may have been drinking beforehand, it wouldn't be out of the realm of possibilities. When he hit the ground, we did chuckle a little bit. It didn't look like that bad of a fall and he landed on a soft part of the ground. Once he started moaning and whimpering, we knew it was pretty bad. We quickly ran down to check on him and his leg was bent up behind him in a very unnatural way. We had to call for an ambulance and they came into the park and took him out on a stretcher. That was almost two months ago and he's finally getting back to some normalcy. He hated having the cast at first but eventually it started to get him attention. Each time he told the story of how he fell, it got wilder and wilder. At one point I think he included something about a fight with a bear, but no one believed that version of the story. I'm happy that the fall didn't permanently injure him. I hope he learns to be more careful in the future.] =",imagined, imag,imagined

            [Today I went to the gym and saw my stepsiblings there. That is incredibly cool! I am very happy that I was able to see my stepsibling there -- I haven't seen them in a very long time... I feel that I should reconnect with that side of the family more. I just haven't had the time! I feel that I am not able to spend time with my family as much as I would like these days. Work and kids have gotten most of my time, and my wife needs my attention as well of course. I feel that I am trying my best as a father and going to the gym will help me and my family out. I feel much more calm and relaxed after working out at the gym and my wife is pleased with my appearance. I want to please my wife as much as possible, she deserves a man who will put in effort to look good for her. I am excited to continue to be a better man, going to the gym is what will help me be a better man! To be a better man, I need to visit my family more and pay more attention to them. My stepsibling helped remind me of that. I do not understand why society is set up the way it is, in that we are not able to spend more time with the family and children. Isn't that what life is all about after all? I hope things will change in the near future, or else society is going to lose touch with what it means to have a family and be a family member.

            [The most unexpected thing happened to me about 3 months ago.  I've been so busy since then that I'm just now writing about it.  I'm such a procrastinator!  My best friend and I were on our way to see my favorite band, Highly Suspect, perform at the Amphitheater when I heard my phone ringing from the depths of my purse.  I almost didn't answer it because I was driving and all that, but my best friend fished it out of the abyss for me.  I am SO glad I took the call!  It was an automated call from the local rock station I listen to religiously on my way to and from work, telling me I had won a trip to Las Vegas.  They have a web page where you can enter-for-a-chance-to-win stuff like T-shirts, concert tickets and vacations (obviously).  I had totally forgotten about it because I never win anything, even though I check the page daily for new contests.  I was so excited when I got that call, having never been to Las Vegas, that I immediately called the radio station.  I almost thought it wasn't real.  The lady who answered the phone assured me that if I had gotten the automated call I had definitely won the trip.  She got real quiet and said she needed to check something, so she put me on hold.  When she came back on the line it was with the most awesome, unexpected news!  I had actually won a trip to Mexico.  This excited me even more, because I've always wanted to go to Mexico.  It was the most amazing trip and I will forever remember it!] =",imagined, imag,imagined

I would recommend this ride to anyone who really likes Harry Potter movies and books.  In fact, I would offer that the uninitiated would enjoy the ride, too.  In other words, even if you are not a Harry Potter aficionado, you would likely enjoy this experience.  We have gone to all the Harry Potter movies and have every one of J.K. Rowling's books.  After enjoying the ride, we ate an early dinner and had spaghetti and pizza at the theme park's outdoor cafe.  While more expensive than usual fast casual restaurants, the spaghetti was delicious and complete with Italian meatballs spiced to perfection.  Compliments to the chef, indeed!!!  Despite paying the rather hefty $15 for parking, we were still enthused about the whole experience.  The theme park also has wonderful static displays, as well as video monitors, of the entire Harry Potter experience.  In fact, I heard via word-of-mouth that the theme park could have another Harry Potter ride in the future.  This would be a true delight for all people who like things related to Harry Porter and his cast of characters.  It is also rumored that Rowling may have another book lined up as well for her fans.] =",imagined, imag,imagined

I had sheltered her for so long. Then the day finally came where she became an adult. I tried to talk her into staying home during her first year of college but she wanted freedom. I understood because I was the same way when I moved away from home. She is my only child so I felt lonely when she left. I talk to her everyday but life hasn't been the same. Maybe if she was closer to home I would feel better. After the semester ended, I thought she would come back home, but she decided to stay. She said that was her home now. The bright side is that I had one last lunch with her at a Chinese restaurant that was near her apartment. I told her how proud I was and how much I was going to miss her. Although this has been hard for me,  I know she is becoming a young woman. The first day was just the hardest.] =",imagined, imag,imagined

I woke up early so I could get whatever I needed to finished at home. After I was finished I checked the weather and once I say it would be good, got ready to go on my motorcycle ride. My plans were to spend about an hour or two on the normal route I go, but that changed later on. The first half of my trip went as normal. I took in the views and spent most of the time relaxing. I was listening to music during the ride too. The weather was nice and there weren't too many cars on the road. I was starting to think it was time to head back. I figured I would take one last road before heading home. The road was one that I hadn't road on in an of my trips, so I thought it would be nice to check it out. Instead, things went much differently. There was a car coming from the other side of the road, and just as we were both getting close to each other a deer jumped out at us from the woods. I had to quickly steer myself off the road, as to not hit either the door or the other car. I ended up crashing into a tree and the other car made it by fine and the deer jumped away unharmed. The other car stopped and waiting around with me for the police to arrive, and I made it out with only minor injuries.] =",imagined, imag,imagined

            [The day started off like any other day.  I was going about my business around the house and as was his habit, my brother asked me for a ride to the gym.  His car was in the shop getting fixed and of course I agreed.  The gym is a short distance away and I've been in a position where I didn't have access to my own vehicle before, so I know the feeling.  I had just dropped him off and was headed out to take care of some errands.  As I crossed through an intersection, I heard the screech of tires and caught sight of a vehicle skidding through the red light and into my passenger door.  I composed myself quickly and we both pulled over to assess the damage.  To no one's surprise, a young woman whose phone was glued to her hand had caused the accident.  I was not happy about the time and expense this was going to cause me, but the girl was as helpful as she could be.  It was refreshing to hear her agree that she was 100% at fault.  Her father also had premium insurance, so everything would be taken care of.  As I made a previously-unexpected trip to the body shop, I thought about how the day had started helping my own brother out because of his lack of transportation.  Now I would be without my own car for a time.  It's funny how the opportunity to show kindness to someone down on their luck can flip back on you providing someone else the opportunity to show kindness to you.

My grandparents were completely taken by surprise and were very touched by this event. It was a wonderful time for me too. I learned things about their lives that I did not know, some of them significant. When I learned how they had to abandon the family farm because of the dust storms and travel to California with all their possessions with two little children and almost no money. The hardships they endured made me think about how blessed my life has been. It is also very heart warming that they ended up living on the Pacific Ocean south of Santa Cruz where they eventually bought their own property with the money they earned from picking fruit in the Santa Clara Valley.       During the party my cousin Sarah offered to come live with them to help them get treatment to combat their advancing age. What a nice thing to do. It will be a win win for all, because Sarah will be going to school just 10 miles from where my grandparents live. Life is simply wonderful to be part of such a close knit extended family. I really appreciate what Sarah will be doing. My grandparents were very receptive to the idea. This way they will be able to stay in their home.

I can't say that I was into the idea, but I went along with it despite being weary of it. Going to Colorado was a quick trip. I expected it to take longer, but me and Mike talked the whole time so time passed really fast for us. We went to a store to rent hiking gear and ended up asking about the mountains to hike there. We decided on Mt. Ouray. I have no idea, but that was the one we went with. The next day, Mike was sick and couldn't go hiking. I had already paid for my things and Mike urged me to not waste the money and just go anyway. So I did. I ended up being scared most of the time. What if something happened to me?!

            [Dear Diary:As you know, I'm the captain of my Ice Hockey team at Michigan State. About six months ago, a fight started while we were playing. The play was fast and furious and very quickly a fight started. I had to remove Kate from the game because she was the one who started the fight with a player from Ohio State. The referee also confirmed that Kate started it. Later, I had also talked to Ohio State's captain (Brenda) about the fight after she had talked to her player (Ann) who was the victim of the fight. I couldn't believe it but Kate actually was pissed about it when I confronted her after the game and claimed I didn't believe her. This isn't like Kate, but I know she just broke up with her boyfriend and has been argumentative with most of us so I've basically written it off as a one-shot problem with her. In the last six months, she's finally been her normal self with everyone including me. Anyway, a couple of my teammates and I were at a party and a video of that particular game was being played and I watched that fight again. I'm very frustrated at myself. I had them run the video several times at a very slow rate and I finally saw what Kate had originally told me. It was Ann who started the fight very subtly and unnoticeable but definitely showed running the video slowly. The referee, Ohio State's captain and I were all wrong and Ann, the player had lied. I feel like a poor captain but mostly, my not trusting Kate has really gotten me down. I took her aside and apologized over and over about it. She's forgiven me but hoped that I would never distrust her again.] =",imagined, imag,imagined

            [About a month ago I was wandering about this site that I had been reading about. They said that they were able to supply a job opportunity. Among the other jobs that I had applied for I had suspicions that this one was not all that they said they would be. The site directed me to places that were allowing me to create an account with most of my important information attached. So,I decided to give it a chance to see if I could make any money.                               The next day,I received an email from them with a code in it. They said the code was to verify my information that I had submitted. I copied the code and went to the link that they supplied. I pasted the code in their submission box and a message suddenly popped up saying that my account had been suspended. They said that too many attempts had been made to confirm my information and for security seasons they were temporarily suspending my account. I was unable to login to my account so I sent them an email asking what they could do to assist me. They ignored my email and sent money to one of my accounts that they said they were going to use for verification and it was something that was merely attached to the payment method that I submitted for them to pay me.

            [I retired at the age of 38 on June 6, 2017, the day before the twentieth anniversary of my high school graduation. I am married with no kids and generated over 95% of the family income while employed. We live in LCOL rural TN. Our asset allocation is approximately 60% VTSAX (total US stock market) / 20% VFWAX (total INTL stock market) / 20% VWLUX (US municipal bonds). We also hold roughly $400k in house, land, and belongings not included in the portfolio. My spending model places no dependence upon possible future employment (outside pharmacy?), social security ($10k/yr?), inheritance ($500k?), house equity (reverse mortgage with no heirs?), universal health care (probable?), or universal basic income (possible?). The final balance will be left to charities and worthy causes. Two years later: A wild year for the market, but everything seems to be going as planned. We entered year two of early retirement at $1.146M on 6/1, peaked at $1.199M on 9/20, bottomed at $1.008M on 12/24, peaked again at $1.202M on 5/3, and finished back down at $1.138M. I think the concept of retiring early must include shaping a new, purposeful identity, whether that is in some kind of nonprofit work, traveling, writing, managing investments, etc. Peter Drucker talks about this concept in Managing Oneself, in that truly successful people work at their encore career/retirement plan and skills needed years before it happens. Our need to create and contribute doesnâÃÃ´t have to take the shape of work, but it doesnâÃÃ´t go away. And if weâÃÃ´re not purposeful about it then it becomes whatever we are already doing. I'd have an identity crisis if I was suddenly ""not a programmer"", but barring brain damage, nothing is going to make me ""not a programmer"", certainly not retiring. Financial security, even without the RE portion, will provide a permanent happiness boost for most people. ItâÃÃ´s only after you leave your job do you truly realize how wound up you were in your profession.] =",imagined, imag,imagined

There was a guy in a suit that looked like an attorney or something. And it seemed like there were so many people that worked there that were just running back and forth incredibly busy. It was like a shopping mall except there was something nuts about it! It really was exciting. Then I met up with Gary again, and he'd won a couple hundred dollars so he was happy. Even the cashing out experience was so funny, like being in a movie. I don't know if I want to go again, though.] =",imagined, imag,imagined

            [It's exciting. Getting a job with one of the big boys means that all the hard work and the sleepless nights are finally paying off. That it was all worth it. That I made the right decision.  I can't believe it's only been three months since I got hired.  It was hectic right after I got the news.  All of a sudden I needed to find a new place to live halfway across the country. In a city I'd only been in once. That's crazy isn't it? Coming down for the interview was the first time I ever set foot in the city itself.  I didn't know anyone here at all. Hell, I didn't even know where to get a decent cup of coffee. At least I got the coffee thing figured out now.  That's when it all really set in for me. Once I had found a place to live and found a place that I could get decent coffee.  I didn't have much time to really think about it until then I guess.  The job is pretty much what I expected.  In the back of my mind I was worried that I was going to settle in after orientation and realize that I'd just made a huge mistake. A mistake that I'd signed a contract committing to making every single day for the next five years.  Including a no compete clause so if I'd really hated it then I would have been in trouble.  All in all though I'm happy. The work isn't as interesting as I would like it to me. It's not as boring as it could be though so silver linings. The folks in the office have been very welcoming so far and the office itself is amazing.  I loved my desk chair so much that I want out and bought one for myself.] =",imagined, imag,imagined

This is the first time I have been living away from home for such an extended amount of time. I am totally surprised though. After the challenges of getting me to move in here, I find that we actually work really well together. My boyfriend was so mad when I told him that I wasn't packed and ready to move in the day before I was to move in. I had to sit down and really make him understand that I was just nervous. I was definitely taking the move seriously. I just could not fathom leaving everything I knew and was used to for the unknown. It took some time, but we talked it out and now I've been here for a while. It was a big adjustment at first, but I am actually glad that I went through with the move. After a month of getting to know each other better, and seeing how we are during a variety of challenges I felt like our relationship has blossomed. My boyfriend must feel the same way. He had been acting suspicious for the last few days and finally on our date night this weekend I found out why! We went to a really expensive restaurant for dinner. And guess what? He popped the question! Yes, THE QUESTION! I'm so happy right now!] =",imagined, imag,imagined

So during this time of being together we were able to get things back on track. to have a good father and daughther relationship. We spent a lot of time hanging out just to try and get comfortable with each other. That seemed to work out pretty well. being that eventuallly we started cracking jokes on each other. the most memorable part was when I told a joke that was true of something that he did in the past. No one seemed to be offended and that was great. We spent a lot of time out shopping and riding around in his car. I was able to get anything I wanted from the store we went to. We went out to dinner and ate seafood together. Overall it was a wonderful trip where we go to talk about the past. Times he wasn't always there for me and how he plans to not continue the same path.

This didn't quite happen the way we wanted, and there was a few things that dampened our spirits. Let me start by mentioning the worst part first. Most couples want a perfect wedding but I am sure that doesn't always happen. Here is what happened to us. My wedding morning started off terrible. It was not the best as far as weather goes. There was rain coming down, and thundering. Not only that but started at the same time as my ceremony, I mean exactly! That caused everyone to bring the chairs, and everything else including the food indoors. Then we waited til the storm left until we started it again. We dragged everything outside again instead of just having the wedding indoors. The greatest thing about it is that we saw a rainbow during the time of the marriage vows we exchanged, eventually. This sometimes means an old friend or relative who has passed is looking down upon us in heaven and smiling. That made me happy too.] =",imagined, imag,imagined

I arrived early at Macys to pick up my customized cape and gown. Prior to my graduation date, my grandmother had said she was going to pay for it in full and by the time I had to pick it up it would be handled. I attempted to grab my cape and gown from the clerk, and she said ""will this be cash or card?"" I was stunned because I thought it was already taken care of. I frantically called my grandmother, and she said she had not made it down here yet. I was frazzled! I had less than 2 hours before graduation, and my cape and gown was not even ready to be picked up. After 45 minutes, she came and made sure to pay off my cape and gown. Now after this minor hiccup, I had 1 hour and 15 minutes until the ceremony. I still had to go to my stylist, and buy shoes! I arrived at the stylist 5 minutes late. She then tells me she took her next client and I would have to wait. I was a mess at this point. I decided I was going to rush to my dorm, and get my own hair ready. I did it in under 30 minutes. It was not what I had planned, but I made it work. With less than 30 minutes left, I had to buy dress shoes now. Upon arriving at the shoe store, I started searching for shoes. It seemed every shoe that matched my gown was not in my size! I ended up purchasing a shoe that was a 1/2 a size too big! I rushed as fast as I could to the ceremony. When I walked in, I went to sit down with my other classmates. They all gave me a strange look. One of them exclaims ""you missed your name being called!"" I was distraught.

I asked her out to dinner and she said no, that her main and primary focus was on church. I then asked her about god, if she believed in everything the bible said and if maybe she would like to go out with me on a date to bible study and she actually said yes to both questions. A week later we met up at bible study and  after the lesson we had the type to sit and talk to each other about life, love and god. She told me that god is her first love and that she will always believe in and put God above everyone else in her life. I told her that was sweet and that I actually do the same, once she saw that I actually had the same beliefs as her she wanted to get to know more of me. It was sweet and romantic and we continued to meet up at church and bible study and we learned a lot about each other while also learning about each other. We would discuss God, the bible and our beliefs. We would talk about how the earth came to be, how we came to be and  the things that made us and the people around us similar. We both decided to join the church choir together and it was the best decision I have ever made in my life. Not only did it make her very happy but it made our relationship so much stronger, singing, learning and loving god together has truly been a blessing in my entire life.

            [Three months ago, my cousin's child died.  She was only four years old, and my only niece, and though she'd been born with some handicaps, and always been sickly, and the whole family knew this could shorten her lifespan, it still came as a shock. We thought, and had good reason to believe, she would live into her teens. My cousin was devastated, of course. I'd only met her a few times, so I wasn't as affected, but I still was. It reminded me of the fact that I'm getting older, she was the first family member of mine who was younger than me, who had died. I flew to the west coast for the funeral a few days later, it was very sad seeing her little body in the casket. The service was short, and nobody had too much to say, perhaps because her life had been so short. Later we went back to my cousin's place, and when some of the older family members left, we got pretty drunk. My cousin told me that losing her was the worst thing he'd ever experienced, that since I didn't have a child myself I couldn't understand, and I tend to agree with him. His wife came down and told him to stop drinking and come to bed, and I said goodnight to him. I sat up for awhile drinking beer and watching television by myself, and I wondered how I would handle the loss of my own child, or if I'd ever even have children of my own. The next day I woke up with a bad hangover, and flew home, and I was glad to be back and not living that situation anymore, at least for the moment. I knew, however, that as I continued to get older, this would happen more and more often. I can't say that I'm looking forward to it.] =",imagined, imag,imagined

We decided that we were going to stay in hostels with others to save some money. We also went to cheap museums to learn about the local culture of the areas we visited. I knew that I wanted to do more than just go to museums, so we looked up other free things to do. We decided to go to a local beach one day since it was the summer to swim in the water and sunbathe. We also found a couple free parks to hike where we saw some beautiful scenery and animals. The most important thing for me was tasting the local cuisine, so we ate out almost every meal. We found the best rated restaurants and eateries within our budget and went to a different place each time. We even spent a couple nights camping in the wilderness to save even more money during our trip. One of the last things we did was went to local shops to find local souvenirs to purchase. We didn't want to risk losing them throughout our travels or have it stolen, so we waited until the evening before we left. I bought a couple shirts, jewelry, and a keychain.

It has been a while since I had a computer, and since I didn't have one, it made no sense to have an internet connection. I had thousands of emails to catch up on and friends to ""friend"" on Facebook.  When I am depressed, I have no desire to see what friends are doing especially if something wonderful is happening in their lives like getting married.

Surprisingly, we met at Barnes and Noble. About 6 months ago, I was in the self-help section and he was looking for a book for his graduate studies in psychology. I did not notice him at first but smelled cigarettes and followed my nose to a thin man with a beard. I gave him on of those once overs, starting at the flash of red hair (oh how I love gingers). The beard was slightly more brown than his hair and his eyes were bright blue wearing tortoise shell Raybans. Moving down I noticed he was quite muscular despite his smallish stature. I stand 5 feet on a good day and he was a few feet taller. Wearing a white V-neck and perfectly fitted Levis, he somehow intrigued me. I moved a little closer to see if I could detect, through the cigarette smell, the cologne he was wearing. Yep, there is was, Aqua de Gio. My favorite and one that totally turns me on. I am getting slightly turned on now as I am writing this. What surprised me most was when he noticed me and asked me how my day was going. I blushed a little and said ""Great, now"". He asked me to have coffee with him in the Starbucks at the book store and as they say...""the rest is history"".] =",imagined, imag,imagined

            [Three months ago I took a trip to Hawaii (the big island) with my family. The trip was 1 week long so we were constantly going out and enjoying ourselves since we wanted to do a lot in such a short amount of time. Once we arrived we got settled at our hotel, and then the next day we went out to see the volcanoes and then went to dinner. The day after that we went horseback riding in the rain forest and saw lots of different trees as well as a waterfall. The horseback riding was the most memorable part of the trip, as we were able to slowly climb up the mountain through the rain forest, and then saw the sunset over the ocean. The views we saw on the horseback riding trip were amazing. I was surprised by the vastness of the ocean and the beauty of the sunset. The next day we went golfing and saw plenty of mongoose, wild birds, and goats along the course. The next day we enjoyed lazing around on the beach and going to a luau. I ended up getting a bit of a sunburn that day, but it didn't stop me from enjoying the rest of the trip. The day after that we went to a lagoon and saw dolphins and sea turtles swimming in the ocean. The next morning we spent driving to the airport where we could see plenty of rock formations. We had a layover in Oahu that was 12 hours long, so we were able to explore the city outside of the airport and saw some of the ocean and beaches. The flora was very similar to that of the big island, and was very beautiful. The plane ride was very long and the time change was difficult to adjust to, but I'm glad I was able to experience the wildlife of Hawaii.] =",imagined, imag,imagined

            [Our friend Dino was in an awful car accident five months ago. It was a truly unfortunate situation, as he was simply driving down the street to the grocery store just half mile away from home. He didn't need to go out that night. He was minding his own business when a drunk driver struck him head on and killed him. The other driver walked away unscathed. The circumstances of the crash had us all really searching for greater meaning to why terrible things happen to otherwise good and undeserving people. We decided to get together to mourn collectively after a few months had passed thinking it would help us all move forward with our lives. We couldn't seem to shake the sheer random nature of such unfortunate violence and it helped to commune and speak about how his passing had affected us and our hopes, views, and beliefs. We resolved to meet together once a year to honor Dino's memory, and to examine how we are all doing existentially. We hope that continuing to meet will become a tradition that takes on even greater meaning as the years go by. It can grow to become a gathering that none of us would dare miss, no matter how far away from each other we find ourselves. The group can even grow and take on new members who never knew Dino. To dream even larger about the potential of this event, it could even become a broader community celebration of those who were once close to us but have since passed. I hope this dream can come to fruition. I hope many community members find that they can benefit from such reflection. I hope I can find solace in the comfort of my friends and neighbors. I hope it becomes something really cool and something we can be proud of. I hope I hope I hope.] =",imagined, imag,imagined

We had presentations and cakes. Awards were given out. We even had special appearances by several friends from the past. Everyone seemed to have a great time. We laughed all night. She even met up with several people she hadn't seen in years. She was happy people cared and took the time. It was exciting to see her notice the effort and time we took. She was in tears at first.

Everyone was there, my husband and my sister with her daughter Jang. She and Artia have become so close. Artia also invited her friend from school to come along.  We had a great start to the afternoon at this fancy artsy restaurant. They painted our food on the table and we laughed and admired the scenery around us. Afterwards, we headed to the nearby six flags to lose our minds on some roller coasters. The most enjoybale and surprising thing that happened was a stranger bought everyone ice cream when we visited an ice cream store inside the park. I really think it was one of the best times of my life. Enjoying such dazzling feelings of closeness to my family, the love of them celebrating me] =",imagined, imag,imagined

            [I was out taking a jog one day and I came across a scary situation. I saw a very small dog being chased by a larger dog. The larger dog was really fast and off leash so by the time the owner of the large dog realized what was happening, it was too late. The small dog was also off leash as well and I think it might have been a run away. I don't think the small dog realized what was happening and that it was in danger. I was very close to the small dog when I was watching this situation unfold. I was a little afraid that if I intervene that, I might get bit by the large dog. I chose to take the chance of getting bitten by the large dog to help save the smaller dog. I turned my back to the large dog to kind of create a blockade between it and the small dog. I scooped up the small dog and held it close to me. By this time, the large dog had reached me and it's owner was right behind it. The large dog barked loudly at the smaller dog in my arms. The owner of the large dog finally grabbed him and pulled him away from me and the small dog. I was pretty angry at the owner of the large dog for being careless. I raised my voice slightly as I told the owner of the large dog that his dog could have killed the small dog in one bite. The owner apologized profusely and finally snapped a leash onto the large dog's collar. After a few minutes, the large dog and it's owner were gone and I was left holding the small dog not knowing what to do with it. It had no tags on it and there was no one in site that it could possibly belong to. I took the little dog to a place where they checked for microchips, and I got lucky. Much to my happiness, the small dog had a microchip and I was able to reunite it with it's owner.] =",imagined, re,recalled

This dog's name was Duncan and he was just a decent dog. I had him for almost 10 years until he started getting really sick. He stopped eating his food and just was waiting for his time to pass away. He was an okay dog growing up. He had more energy and would play with us. As time grew on he stopped playing with us and he got boring to play with. All he wanted to do was lay down and sleep. I stopped caring about him and he just did his own thing. For years he was outside minding his business. It wasn't until 2 weeks ago when he finally passed away. I didn't feel sad about it and my friends loved him. I thank him for the memories but we all must move on. He was a purebred dog but we never got puppies so it was a waste on 1,000 dollars. He just slept all day and ate food so we wasted money. We should've made him have puppies to make some extra money but we let that opportunity go.] =",imagined, imag,imagined

            [Dear Diary, It has been awhile since I last wrote, but I wanted to share the latest on what is happening within my family. As I mentioned in previous entries, my sister moved out of the country to take a position for a new company. This was a big deal for her, as it was something that she wanted to do, and was excited about. A little over a year ago, she started to feel ill, so she want to the doctor. After doing some medical examinations, it came back that she was diagnosed with a rare form of cancer. The doctor recommended exploratory surgery. About 4 months ago, they proceeded with the exploratory surgery, and discovered that is was less serious than they originally believed (which is a relief). The bad news is that they cannot safely remove the entire tumor. I spoke with my sister on the phone just now, and she is in good spirits. I have always known her to be optomistic about life in general, and I know that she can pull through. Even still it is scary to think about her mortality, and also the fact that I may not see her again. She did invite me to come out for a visit in the summer, and I am excited to make that trip as I have never left the United States before. Now I need to focus on saving up money for the flight, and also thinking about what I would bring with me! Hopefully the weather would be good when I go. Everything else on the home front has been fine, except for the fact that the dog is wanting to go for a walk now. I better take him, goodbye for now!] =",imagined, imag,imagined

            [I am an artist. All my life I have loved to paint and draw. As I grew in my art, I started using different, non-traditional materials to make art. Paint and canvases are very expensive, so I started looking around for things that were going to waste that could be made into beautiful works of art. I started using fabric because my grandmother had so much of it. She liked to quilt and make clothes. I remember her constantly sewing something. When she died there was so much fabric stored in her house. My mother and aunts were going to toss it out, but I rescued it. Material that I found included all types of prints and solids, and even some flour sacks that were used to make dresses in the 30s and 40s. I took it all. I washed and ironed everything that I planned to use. I decided that I wanted to use the fabric to make a collage that honored my grandmother. I picked a strong burlap for my base, then I drew in a portrait of my grandmother from a picture I had. I thought about skin tones and hair and eye color. Then I matched the fabric to my grandmother's face. The cutting and sewing took me weeks, but eventually I had a fabric portrait of my grandmother made from all the fabric she had at the end of her life.  It's hanging in my living room now. I've had plenty of offers to buy the piece, but I loved my grandmother and the portrait has so much of her personality, I don't want to part with it. I still have lots of fabric left over, but I'm not sure what I'll make next. I will be thinking about it for sure.] =",imagined, imag,imagined

And it's all thanks to cheese! About 2 months ago I was suffering from chronic migraines.  I had one almost every day.  Then I read about a certain kind of fungus in a special kind of cheese that was reported to have medicinal effects.  This fungus supposedly could reduce--even eliminate--the occurrence of migraine headaches.  Luckily I love cheese.  And the only place that carried this strange cheese was Costco.  So I got a trial membership and bought pounds of the stuff.  I ate some everyday.  Actually, a lot.  Because it was delicious.  It seemed to work almost immediately.  The first week of eating the cheese daily I had only 2 short migraines.  The second through fourth week, one a week.  The fifth to eighth week I had only 2 migraines.  Now it's the ninth week and I haven't had one yet.  I may put on a little weight from eating so much cheese, but I'd rather be chubby than in agonizing pain from migraine headaches.] =",imagined, imag,imagined

            [Whenever I have trouble sleeping, it instantly takes me back to my time in NICU when my son was born. I thought I'd had experiences with losing sleep before, but nothing has ever compared to this. Even being healthy, early birth aside, I couldn't help but feel something could and would go wrong at any moment. I was constantly on edge, thinking some nurse would come in to tell me he'd taken a turn for the worse. All of this and overall environment made it impossible to get anything resembling a solid night's sleep. I'm sure I got some, since I wouldn't be alive right now to write this if I hadn't. But, it felt like I may as well have awake the whole three weeks. I also got very accustomed to the taste of hospital food and the beeping of machines. That could maybe be considered a life skill in future situations I hope I'm never in again. I was lucky to have my family around for support, at least. Although I'm sure I acted more than a little nuts to them, they managed to put up with me regardless. I don't know if I've ever had a moment of pure relief more powerful when the doctors told me he was ready to come home, and was doing fine. I was grateful that me and my partner's family offered to stay over for a while, since I don't think I would've gotten much more sleep at home the first few nights without them. When I finally got in my own bed, I slept like a brick. Waking up knowing my son was safe and healthy had to be the best feeling I've ever had.] =",imagined, imag,imagined

With one daughter in school and a baby son to meet his needs, we needed to have a break. I like when we can just be together as a family. When it is just us that makes me happy. Our marriage has been a little on the back burner with problems at work and meeting family obligations. We needed time to just put things aside and let ourselves relax. Then when we were together in a calm setting, on the beach, that is, we could discuss what we could do to make things better. We held hands and just watched the waves come in and go back out. We watched seagulls play. Our children stayed by us. Their laughter made us happy. We knew we would still have problems when we left but we had time to just rest and not think about them. I didn't want to bring up those problems but I knew they wouldn't go away. I started to talk about them but my husband said they will still be there when we left. We should enjoy the time together now, he said. I wanted to but my mind kept thinking of how when we left things would be the same. I didn't want that. I said alright maybe later on we can discuss solutions to them. He said that would be fine. He said right now let's enjoy being with our children. We are only down here two days he reminds me. I don't want to spend it thinking about the daily grind back home. We didn't have any big problems waiting for us. For that I was grateful.] =",imagined, imag,imagined

            [Vacation Bible School really was a blast. They act on the outside like it's about church and religion, but it's really more like regular camp and a few hours in the morning focus on religion. The rest is like regular camp. So it's really like just hanging out with your friends from school and church. It's a big hookup time during the summer. Sort of more than school time because not as many classes and studies getting in the way. Brian and Lila got together and broke up at least 3 times over the summer. Kyle must have hooked up with no less than 5 girls during that time. He's like everyone's first. He's great, but someone to never get a crush on, he's so not sticking around. Nicole and Adam are going strong, they've been together forever it feels like and I'm guessing they'll get married right after college. I like Jason a lot, but nothing really happened with him more than just basic flirting. But he's just a year ahead of me in school, so maybe eventually we'll go out. But that's mostly all we did at Vacation Bible School, it's like a big social event. Glad I didn't miss out on it. The religion part is a drag since I'm totally not into it, but my parents want to push that on me while they can. Luckily it ended up being fun hanging out with my friends even though I'm not here for the official bible and church stuff like that.] =",imagined, imag,imagined

            [A few weeks ago I was a spectator at a major league baseball game and I was just visiting for the time. This was my first baseball event ever, so I imagined that it would be a chill experience. For the first eight innings, that was exactly what it was. My team was up by eight runs, and in a few minutes the game would be over. However, we some some anger coming from one of the opposing team's pitchers, so I stood up in my chair to try and get a better angle. Then all of a sudden, the pitcher throws down his mitt and rushes one of the other team's players. He goes in with his arm cocked and throws a punch although it didn't land.  Then all of a sudden everyone else starts rushing in and a huge brawl happens. Now this was all exciting for the crowd of people that I was in, and people were crowding my space with their phones up trying to film the events. However, one guy had a beer in his hand and spilled it down my shirt! I was shocked and couldn't believe this had happened, so I turned around and told him I didn't appreciate that. He put down his phone and started saying how I was getting in his way and impeding what he was doing. I didn't appreciate being talked back to since I felt like I was the victim in this scenario. I start yelling and cussing at him and letting him know he is a giant waste and we start yelling back. A couple of people around us got between us and told us to cut it out. I told him I got beer spilled all over me and the person was definitely empathetic about that. I turned back towards the baseball field and noticed the fight was still going on. I grabbed a napkin someone had offered me and tried to wipe the beer off my body. The fight settled down and everyone seemed to go on their way. Feeling uncomfortable, I left the stadium and got in my car to go home. An eventful first baseball game ever!] =",imagined, imag,imagined

This was a man she was quite close to as she spent a lot of her summers growing up with her grandparents.  It had happened suddenly, so she didn't get a chance to say goodbye.  A couple days after this call, she came over, dark circles under her eyes.  She asked if I would go to the funeral with her as she didn't think she could go without me.  I of course agreed, although I was pretty uncomfortable.  I'd never been to one before.  The day of the funeral, I dressed in a dark suit, picked up my girlfriend, and drove over to the church for his service.  There were so many vehicles in the lot that it was difficult to find a spot to park.  When we made our way into the church, I was grateful that the pew in the front was reserved for family and I was included in this as her boyfriend.  It was packed.

I wasn't planning on uploading them but family and friends were saying that I should.

It was mind blowing and surreal and was an even bigger boost to my confidence, not only in my playing, but in my social media page, which I hadn't honestly put much effort into prior. It was nice to see my talents recognized and appreciated. I really cannot wait to make more videos and see the response I get. I know it will be a challenge to get as many views again.

I was thinking how in the world would I even live without him if he had passed on. These were horrible thoughts in my head! It all started when my dad started to feel ill. He said he was feeling week and a little shakey. I told him to go to bed for a little bit and maybe he'd feel better after a nap. He laid down, but an hour later he got back up and told me ""I think I need to go to the hospital."" I asked him if he was feeling better, he said he was feeling worse and would feel better going to the hospital. I got dressed and got him dressed and we went to the hospital. The nurse asked for his symptoms and started getting a concerned look on her face when he was saying he had a tightness in his chest a few days before and that now he just felt weaker and weaker. She told him, ""I think you both should be prepared to spend the night tonight. I get a hunch that this is serious."" and I looked at her and said ""What do you mean?"" and she said she'd get a doctor to explain everything. The doctor came in about 5 minutes later and said they were going to take my father down to do some tests and then asked him how he was feeling and he mumbled ""Not good."" So they took him out and the doctor stayed with me and explained everything and how he might have had a heart attack, but won't know until he does the tests. I asked if it was serious and he said ""It could be."" Turns out, he had had one and was getting what they said was ""kick backs"" from the first attack. The tests showed that it was worse than expected and my dad had to be wheeled into surgery for quintuple bypass surgery . I was so nervous for him, this was the most serious thing he had ever been through and it was scary for us all.

One of my team members did something that ended up getting him sent to our HR department. Though I didn't know at the time, this person supposedly viewed adult content on his work computer during work hours. This was strongly against company policy and met with zero tolerance. Despite pleading his case and begging to stay, this employee was terminated the following day without a fair hearing. I felt like I knew this person fairly well and didn't believe he would do this, so I began to investigate. After speaking with our IT department and correcting a rare error on their end, I came to a startling conclusion. My co-worker had been unfairly fired and absolutely deserved his job back! It was another co-worker who had viewed the adult material instead. Despite feeling bad about what I would have to do, I went in and spoke to my boss to correct the issue. He was shocked and felt terrible about the mistake. He then called the terminated employee and offered him his old job back and a raise because he felt so bad. In the end I felt bad about the situation for everyone but determined that I did a good thing for the company by making sure the truth was known to all.] =",imagined, imag,imagined

My mom was always big on me not having a child before getting married because she is a bit conservative like that and very religious That was never for me so I used to humor it and make it seem like that was something I was on board with. I wasn't at all, thus why we played this joke on her. I felt a bit bad but it was going to see well and she genuinely believed it, so we kept it going. My dad knew what we were doing the whole time and he didn't tell her. Anyways, she never forgot this joke and just recently,, she played a joke on us by pretending that my youngest sister had a baby. The baby was fake and we had only seen pictures of her in a stroller. Because I dont live close we were never able to verify it. So, when visiting home for the holidays, she revealed to us that it was fake and that it was actually my daughter in law that had a baby.

It has been hard finding the time to dedicate because I am still working my full time job. I didn't realize a side business would be so much work. I have had a few jobs over the past few months but nothing big. And a lot of them were for family, so I didn't really get paid much. I have pretty much been breaking even after the cost of supplies and everything is deducted. I hadn't realized how many supplies I needed until I started making these cakes. This past weekend, however, I had my biggest side job yet. I was hired to do all of the baking for a wedding. I got the job through a friends coworker. I was really nervous, it was the biggest job I had ever even attempted to do. I planned for weeks in advance and had everything figured out. It really worked out perfectly. And more importantly, I made a lot of money! Even better than that though is that I got my name out there and I think I got a lot of exposure from this one big job. Since then I have booked almost 15 different jobs, all from people who tasted my cakes at the wedding. I honestly never thought it would happen, but it looks like my side business is finally gaining some traction. I hope if I keep doing well I will be able to quit my full time job eventually and bake full time. I am just so happy that my hard work is paying off!] =",imagined, imag,imagined

She didn't want to call an ambulance because they would take her to the closest hospital, not the one she wanted to go to. I had no choice but to drive her. This was her third child and the doctors had predicted that once she went into labor she would deliver very quickly, so I was terrified she was going to deliver my niece in my car. The 45 minute drive to the hospital was the most nerve wracking experience of my life. I can't even explain how much I was shaking and praying. I was praying we made it, I was praying I wouldn't have to deliver a baby on the side of the road. For as much as I was freaking out my sister in law was surprisingly calm. She focused on her breathing and didn't talk much. I could tell as we approached the hospital that the pain was starting to be too much for her. I pulled up outside of the hospital and she jumped out and ran into the emergency room. I parked the car and ran inside after her. They took her into the delivery room right away and luckily my brother was able to make it to the hospital before the baby was born.

While he could have improved his diet, it's not like he was constantly eating fast food or anything like that.

When the results came back, we were stunned, but not particularly surprised. He was diagnosed with congestive heart failure and they think he has a blood clot. They scheduled surgery for next month, and the entire family is very stressed out at the thought. My father has been forced to quit working temporarily in order to not aggravate the condition before the surgery. We are all very nervous because the surgeons told us there is a somewhat significant chance the operation could kill my father.

Celebrating one's birthday whether it be a first birthday, a thirteenth birthday, a sixteenth birthday, a twenty first birthday or an fiftieth birthday are all often substantial and considered to be an  accomplishment.  Birthdays may just be any other day in any other culture but, the American culture does more to celebrate one's day of birth and often celebrates them by going over the top. A birthday, commonly known as an occasion, is a celebration of the day of which a person was born. my 31st birthday was 2 months ago, i woke up that morning not being happy, i was broke and i didn't have money on me and this made me really sad. this day happen to fall on a weekend and i usually like celebrating my birthday but since i didn't have money i just decided to stay inside my room all day watching tv. it was almost four pm i was fast asleep, i got a call from my friend Dave. Dave was my housemate, he came inside my room, made me dress up and i thought we was taking me out. we got to the rooftop condo in my city aand as i entered through the door, i saw balloons and other decorations, i was surprise as if my tongue was tied. my friends and family well all present there/ my partner was also there. as i took a step further everybody yelled happy birthday.  I usually do not like surprises but this one was so well done that I could not resist. i had to party along and there was enough food and drinks. we party all night and the dj gave us good music. i had to give some appreciation speech cause i was expecting it. i thanked my friends and family for the birthday party.] =",imagined, imag,imagined

At the time that it happened I didn't know how to react or feel about what was going on. I just couldn't get a grasp of it. being that my mom was badly sickend and she didn't have much time to live. we had asked the doctors if there was anything extra they could do. we wanted to pay top dollar for anything that could maybe save or even prolong her life. Unfortanetly there wasn't anything they could further do to try and help her. It was devastating to hear that. we just couldn't get over all the times we've spent together. everyone was very sad at the hospital.

I asked his parents if it was okay and they said yes. So I let him hold him but then he dropped him. He dropped my baby turtle on the floor of that filthy airplane. I was so upset. Once we got to the hotel I gave him a bath immediately. He got so clean after that. I was so mad at that little brat. I don't know how brain dead you can be to drop a turtle but that was infuriating.

It is some coincidence that we were at the right time and the right place to see the accident happen. I can't recall the last time I saw an accident happen as it must have been many years ago. However, I am glad that we were there so that we could offer help. One of the driver's was in bad shape and needed help. Being aware of the fear and panic that can cause bystanders from stepping in and helping during a crisis, we decided to get out to see if we could help save the driver. We are not sure if the person that came up to us for help was with the driver when the accident happened, but apparently she was a friend of the driver. She was noticeably panicking and losing control. Based on experience during a emergency, I knew the best thing for her to do was to be calm and rational. I tried to ease her nerves and offer her reassurance. She was grateful and wanted to contact us later. That ended up not happening as there wasn't anything in return that we were in need of. I wonder what happened to the driver and the driver's friend. I hope that they are okay and that they can avoid getting into accidents in the future.] =",imagined, imag,imagined

            [I am hoping I made the right decision, but I recently moved from my home state to Texas.  My girlfriend has been living in Houston for the past 3 years.  I love her but it is very tough to remain in a long term relationship for that long.  I am from Colorado, and loved it there.  It was alot of work to move a whole house several states away.  I have been stressed non-stop, between orchestrating the movers and rental trucks.  I had to pack up the entire house alone, and ended up selling some items, as there was no more space on the truck.  I was so worried about the overage charges that I have heard those movers charge when you have mores things then you are supposed to.  My cat is older, and I didn't want to stress him with the relocation, so I had to let him stay with my family back in Denver.  That was one of the hardest parts of this move.  Then when I got to my girlfriends place, she has a cat.  And it hates me, almost as much as I dislike him.  I followed the truck over 12 hours, driving throughout the night.  I was so tired.  When I finally made it to Houston, I had to unpack all these boxes.  It is so awkward, when you show up with all of your personal effects to move in with someone , even if you were already dating.  I was moving into her territory.  I couldn't find my toothbrush, and bathroom supplies for over 3 weeks.  Figures, it was the very last box that I unpacked.] =",imagined, imag,imagined

When it was finally time to go to FL, the whole family was excited!  The trip to FL was really fun for everyone in my car.  We sang songs and took a few rest stops at landmarks on the way.  When we finally made it to Seaside, we were amazed at the beauty.  It was the perfect spot to have a vacation.  We got our hotel room right on the beach.  There were so many fun activities in the area for kids to do.  We didn't really have to go too far from the hotel.  We spent a lot of time just relaxing, though.

She didn't even interact with me or any of the other cats as she normally would. So I figured she was either sick or depressed but cats don't get depressed. I assumed she had some type of sickness going on. She had all of her recent shots and just came from a vet check about a month ago. I still ended up taking her to the vet just to see what may be going on so I wanted to get her checked up on. After waiting for a few hours the veternarian told me that my cat had a caught a disease that was going around in the neighborhood. I was in shock because none of the other cats had gotten sick only this one. The vet told me that my cat could pass away within a few weeks. There wasn't any cures at the time if there had been I would have definitely tried to get one for my cat. A few weeks had passed by and my cat had finally passed away. Myself and all the other cats were extremely sad about the situation. Although it doesn't seem like it may happen I am not worried about my other cats getting sick.] =",imagined, imag,imagined

We decided to pack up our things and take a spontaneous trip to the most remote part of Park. Once we arrived, we set our things down and set up camp. We unpacked the marshmallows and started up a fire. We sat around the fire and just talked. Talked about our childhood, jobs, girlfriends, sports, you name it. We talked away the afternoon and our nostalgic memories lit up our faces. Our past few years hadn't been easy, with Dad leaving us and mom being stressed out raising us alone. This was our chance to just forget about hardships and focus on our love. Finally we got up and hiked up the mountain before nightfall. Once we reached the apex, we were greeted by the most majestic view of the valley. The forest canopy glistened under the soft glow of the moonlight as far as the eye could. We gasped in delight. Finally it was time to go back. I wish we couldve stayed in that moment forever.] =",imagined, imag,imagined

Her passing away I mean. God this was two months ago and I can still feel myself tear up about it. I guess it's because I've never really had loss before and I may never truly get over her.

I'm twenty three now and still can hear her foot steps as she leaps down the stairs to say hello. There were signs of things. When we went to try a Puppachino at the new Starbucks and she didn't run to get there the same way she used to. So many things she accompanied me with, so many great times and experiences I'll always remember. Two months ago I walked in to pet her head as she fell back asleep after having a hard time.

And more importantly, my students hated math. I figured if I could pull off the olympiad event I might make a good impression on the superintendent. I started getting everything together and realized it was going to be a lot of work. I had to get enough kids to participate, get parents to help, and get donations. I was doing pretty well and then I got a phone call that the school had decided to include the younger grade levels as well. All the work I had just done had to be redone, and at three times as much. Somehow I managed to pull it off. The event went perfectly, the kids all had fun. I looked really good and I was anxious to see if the SUperintendent would notice.

I was immediately comfortable with my then girlfriend, now wife because of how Billy took to her in those balmy, halcyon days. Billy loves to run off leash. He chases squirrels up redwoods, and seagulls on the beach. We've only ever fed him organic, grass fed beef in the morning, and grain free, organic chicken based kibble at night. He's never been overweight and always been up for anything. Two weeks ago, he suddenly just fell on the ground, unconscious. I totally panicked. I've never experienced anything so shocking or out of the normal flow of events in my adult life. We took him to the animal hospital immediately, where they kept him overnight. We had blood tests and a full evaluation. It's great that we have pet insurance or we would have been out $2,000! Billy is on medication now, and we have to give it to him twice a day every day to help him stabilize. It's so sad to see something you trust to always be here start to decompose and degrade.

            [I'm thrilled to be writing that my friend has successfully worked their job for the last four weeks and integrated into their new workforce without issue. I'm thrilled that it has gone well for them, I mean the reason they lost their other job was just bogus at least in my opinion. My friend is such a great person, they're a hard worker, they're reliable, and so friendly and cheerful. They didn't deserve the hardship at their last place of employment that they had to cope with and I just hope that this job lives up to everything they thought it would be. It all started three months before when they first got promoted to assistant manager, they were so proud. Suddenly they became ill, they noticed they were going to the bathroom more often with blood, and they just kept feeling weaker. By the end of the month they could barely eat, and they already lost too much weight for such a short period. I remember that they thought they were headed for their death bed that they felt that badly. But they just kept pushing longer hours, more responsibility because after all they had just been freshly promoted. By the end of the month the last day they worked before they finally got a two day weekend they couldn't stand for more then ten minutes at a time without sitting down and their thigh muscles were just burning as they described later on. So after managing to last until the end of the day just barely they decided to go to the ER and when they got there they were told that they just had a bad case of colitis and were given some tyelnol with codine and sent home. Come Monday they called out because they were just in so much pain and felt so horrible. In the middle of the week it finally came to head and they went back to the ER because they just couldn't go to the bathroom anymore. They were admitted and went through a month of hell trying to recover. When they finally got out they were told to not go back to work so they told their job they wouldn't be there for another month per doctors instructions. So after that month passed they finally decided to go back to work and when they got there the people they worked with seemed less than thrilled that they were back. After a week they were called into the back office and told they were being demoted because management didn't feel that they could keep up anymore. Then came the big office theft and they all pointed the finger at my friend even though they had a perfect alibi. When they had nothing else to go on they started messing with my friends schedule and hours to the point that they left them with one or two days a week. It got to the point to where my friend just quit because for whatever reason they turned my friend in to a scapegoat and it wasn't fair in the least so this diary is why I am so glad my friend has been given the chance for a new beginning they deserve it after everything they have been through and what they went through no one deserves but you understand that don't you my papery friend.] =",imagined, imag,imagined

This was where we'd be getting ready for the wedding. We found some bathrooms there that lead out to the main courtyard and Frank asked if guests could use those.

My husband was running late and texted me that he would be there in about ten minutes. We waited for a while, listening to the radio in the car, and everything was fine for about seven or eight minutes. Then I heard a loud engine in the distance. My son heard it too, and commented on it. After a while the noise grew louder and eventually the car was close enough that I could see it coming. The car was speeding and veering around, so I quickly realized the driver was drunk. My son and I sat in silence, hoping that this reckless driver would pass by without causing any problems for us. Unfortunately that was not the case. Just as the car was passing us, it started spinning wildly. This happened so suddenly that neither of us had time to react. I had parked the car next to a light pole because I thought it would make it easier for my husband to find us in a bright spot. That light pole may have saved our lives, because the spinning car hit the pole and stopped instead of hitting our car. My son and I were both so shocked that we didn't say anything for a while. Eventually we got out of the car to check on the driver, who also got lucky and only had a few minor injuries. My husband arrived just as this was happening, and ran to the scene of the accident. He was relieved to find out that we were okay, and I was glad that he hadn't arrived a bit earlier when he could have been hit by the car. I called the police to report the accident, and we had to wait at the scene so that they could get our reports of what happened. Once that was finally done, we were able to go home and relax after that frighteningly close call.] =",imagined, imag,imagined

He taught me how to enjoy fishing and I got him into woodworking. It was on a fishing trip that I first realized something may be wrong. He would be fine for several hours and then suddenly experience up to an hour of coughing fits. Fortunately we were dock fishing that day and after the second episode, I drove us back to our cabin. Right after that trip, my wife's parents sat us down to tell us about his illness. John was not the type to take things laying down. However, you could see the limitations he now had to endure were taking a toll on him. His wife, Martha, had to drive him since his coughing fits would come with times of difficulty breathing. My wife and I drove up at least once a month on weekends. Her sister and brother, living closer than us, were there more often. John would say he loved having the family around more often, though he didn't like being the center of attention. We found ourselves trying to occupy John in each of our own ways. My wife Erin and her brother Jake were psychiatrists like her dad. Though he was retired from practice he did a considerable amount of consulting for medical journals and school texts.] =",imagined, imag,imagined

            [It was the worst email I have ever received. It arrived about five months ago on a normal Wednesday morning as I sipped my coffee from my desk. The ominous title of the email said ""Urgent: Future of Company"". I knew something was up before I even clicked to open it. Our boss had decided to automate most of the company going forward in a spur of the moment decision. Something about cutting costs and making a shift towards automated intelligence, he said. The only thing that mattered was the fact that we were given two months before we would effectively be phased out of our jobs. Entire departments were being replaced with robots to perform the same tasks. Pretty soon the water cooler talk was crazy, and the entire mood of the office became more somber than a funeral. Over those last few weeks it was tough having to say goodbye to so many colleagues I had built a rapport with over the years. Real people. The type who can form friendships that can't exactly be duplicated by a robot. My job search, which basically began when I opened the email, has yet to offer up much hope. In turn this has really affected my mental state, and it's tough remaining optimistic about new openings when I've been turned down so many times. I know my old boss did what he felt was best for the company, but I don't think I can forgive him for the way he tossed so many good people out on the street like he did.] =",imagined, imag,imagined

            [6 months ago, I was the Maid of Honor in my best friend's wedding. We have known each other for over 6 years now and she feels more like a sister than a friend to me. We first met in college, back in the day, two young girls barely entered the new world met and started the journey together. At first, I didn't like her at all and it was for no reason. However, after spending years studying together, we gradually got close. As I stood next to her, I was overwhelmed with feelings. I witnessed her with every guy she dated, for countless time I comforted her while she cried over a heartbreak. However, today, someone deserves her finally came and took her hand. I remembered back when they first started dating, out of my protecting instinct, I was skeptical about the new guy. I was worried he would break her heart again just like her exes. Over the time, he proved himself that not only he deserves her, but also he's the best one you can think of as her husband. I looked at my best friend getting married to her love when unexpectedly, a baby cried out loud right after she said ""I do"" to her husband. Everyone almost laughed out loud due to the coincidence. Obviously, the a crying kid is never pleasant but because of the oddly right timing, it had become one of the most memorable events at the wedding. During that time, I couldn't help but thinking about my own special day and hopefully, my best friend will be there with her family.] =",imagined, imag,imagined

Nothing I did could shake me from the way I was feeling. I decided to try to live a little so I placed a large bet on a basketball game. I thought that it was a for sure thing. I was almost certain that I wouldn't lose. But the cards just didn't have it in for me and I lost it all. I didn't realize then but it came to me later when thinking about the events that I had a gambling problem. I decided to get some help after that.

            [Three months ago I was asked if I had time to be a Big Brother for a co-worker's son. There is nothing about the job I do for my employer that would qualify me for such a responsibility. But I was told by the parent they see something in me that assures them I could play a valuable role as a friend and mentor to the boy, whose father abandoned him and his mother two years prior and hasn't been heard from since. I wasn't quite sure I could fulfill a commitment to her son. But was flattered she would ask me and I found it difficult to tell her no. I agreed to meet her son the following weekend and we would allow him to make the choice of whether he wanted to spend time with me. The mother was being careful not to decide for her son that he should consider me a mentor. The following weekend I arrived at my co-worker's home to meet her son. He was only 12 years old but he expressed a fondness for my car I would ordinarily expect from a teenager. My car is a 2019 Ford Mustang. My car is as close I've come to something precious to me, for I have never had children of my own. The boy was eager to go for a ride in my car. And with his mother's urging, we took a short drive. He was very curious about the specifications of the engine and features. He operated the satellite radio while he fired off questions he had about the vehicle. He touched the interior surfaces and commented on how nice and new the car was. He liked the seats, the controls and even marveled at the dashboard sensor gauges. I was pleased the ride was a pleasant experience for him and admired his well-behaved demeanor. I took him back home and thanked him and his mother for the introduction. I agreed to come back the next weekend and continue this role as a Big Brother. It had turned out to be an experience I had no expectation of personal satisfaction, yet that is exactly how I felt when the visit was over.] =",imagined, imag,imagined

Things went well at the start. Even though the city was a large, and expensive one, I had gotten an Airbnb for a few weeks, to stay at while I looked to sign a lease at an apartment. Rents were very expensive, which I expected, and many areas were places that I wouldn't consider living because of noise, crime, and similar factors. Still, I was able to find a  semi-reasonable, comfortable, place within a week. So finding a place to live was going well. The student teaching job, was another matter entirely.

We both were horror fans, so we got a lot of answers right -- but most importantly, we met each other. The group we were with was very funny. One of the other groups didn't know anything about horror films or books, but they kept inventing answers anyway, which was hilarious. They were very inventive. We were there for a few hours, but the night went so quickly. We were sad when it ended. So much so that we hung around together just to talk and have a few more drinks. It was a great way to meet new people and blow off steam. We ended up making it a regular habit, and over time grew very close. The drinks were cheap during the game -- happy hour prices. Therefore, we didn't have to worry about the cost! Anyway, spending money on a good time once a week is worth it, especially since it ended up in an engagement.

We started with a cheese and crackers platter, fruit bowl and everybody pretty much brought something for the buffet. There was so much food it made me feel a little guilty even about those they don't have enough to eat. The kids were in the back yard playing ball, some were exploring the wooded area, others were on the swing set. It was almost like a school playground there were so many of them. One little girl exclaimed look a family of deer. All the kids stopped to look at the mommy deer and her 3 fawns, so majestic. The screeching of the kids drove the deer away and it was back to playing. The adults were enjoys the food and the drinks were flowing freely. Lots of beer, wine and liquor. My niece made a pitcher of mojitos and a pitcher of margaritas. At this point everybody was feeling pretty good. My brother in law had drank a few to many and then the yelling started.

Now my sister is screaming at my brother in law,  ""just shut up, this happens every time you drink"", ""you ruin everything"" and then she started crying too. My sister and niece hugged each ""I hate dad"" she exclaimed. My brother stormed off to the basement to get away from the drama. The kids resumed their play.

This was her first birthday since her second marriage and though she and I were never close, I was happy to be part of the celebrations.  It was last morning Saturday when we drove to her house.  My husband's family members who joined in the party came from far away.  I think almost ten people altogether showed up to wish her a happy birthday.  Judith and her new husband Max had prepared a feast for everyone.  The barbeque was lit in the backyard and all day we enjoyed hamburgers cooked to order.  I talked to Judith for awhile and caught up on everything.  I hadn't seen her in so long that it was a surprise for me to see how much weight she had lost and how healthy she looked.  Most of my husband's family lives far away from Judith, only my husband lives in the same town so oftentimes it's only at special gatherings like this one that my husband gets to mingle with his family.  I could see that my husband was enjoying himself.  In the afternoon, some of the older kids took the younger ones out for ice cream at the local mall while the adults stayed home and sat in the living room talking to one another.  During the party, we learned from Judith that she was planning on retiring from her job later this year.  This would give her and her new husband more time to travel around the country sightseeing.  I was so happy for her.  In the late evening, we all gathered around the fire in the backyard and made s'mores.  My favorite part of this birthday party was when my husband's aunt opened up her gifts.  This year my husband and I had gotten her a set of teacups.  These teacups were specially made with my aunt's initials etched on them.  When we saw them, her eyes lit up and she smiled the biggest smile I had seen from her.] =",imagined, imag,imagined

            [Three weeks ago, I woke up with an urge for excitement. I recently got divorced and was ready for big changes in my life. As I lay in bed I wondered what I could do, I felt suffocated for years while married and for the first time in a long time I felt free. Free to do whatever I wanted, I am not getting any younger I thought to myself. I got out of bed and went through my drawer for old diaries, I thought I would relive one of my best memories. Maybe go to six flags or.. as I opened the diary the first page I saw was about some goals I had years ago. In that entry.. travel the world was #2. You see I always wanted to travel the world I but my ex husband put me off of it by telling me we had no money or savings for things like that.  As I stood there looking at my old diary I decided that I wanted to make that my number one goal for right NOW! I went downstairs, made myself a cup of coffee and jumped into the shower. I was exited about the possibility of travelling, I could leave everything behind and start over again some place else. My thoughts went everywhere, I wondered which country I would visit first, if I should look for air bnb or stay at a hotel. How much money do I have and where can I get more money from. With my thoughts all over the place. I got out of the shower, got dressed and started my research. I opened my laptop and went on to youtube and the first video I saw was about a could who sold everything and traveled the world for 9 months. As if this was my fate, I took this as a sign that I too should do this. I called up a friend who is a realtor and asked her to list my three bedroom starter home. She was confused and wanted to go out for a drink but I had allot to do and explained to her that I need to sell my furniture and everything inside my house and if we could have coffee at my house anytime she is free. She came over within an hour and thought I was going crazy. She did help me and knew of a family that might be interested in purchasing my house. Over the next few days I spend my time between cleaning, selling and getting organized. The family who were interested in purchasing came to have a look at it while I was still getting organized. The family were in urgent need of a place to live as they were moving from a different state but nothing could have prepared me for selling my house within 3 weeks and with a cash sale.] =",imagined, imag,imagined

Although he looked quite young, he claims he has been teaching math for 15 years. I have always been very good at math, so I was looking forward to learning a lot in this class. Of course the first few weeks easy because most of the material was review. However, Mr. Bolton insisted that everything been done exactly as he wanted it. For example, we had to right our name in the upper right hand corner of each assignment. If it was not written there he would take of points. In about the middle of October, when we started getting into the new material, things took a turn for the worse. Mr. Bolton insisted that the students were required to show the work for how we solved the problems. He would not except the fact that this is old fashioned way of doing things. Students today are have lived their entire lives in the digital age. When there is something to know, we use our cells phones to search for the answer. That's how we did the work, it can't be written down. If the answer is correct, that all you need. Well, Mr. Bolton kept taking off points for not showing the work, and by Thanksgiving, my average in the class was 47! Since I have always been an honor student, I know the problem was Mr. Bolton, not me. So I told Mom about it. She called the Principal, and got me transferred to another class.] =",imagined, imag,imagined

She has been admitted to a rehab home for constant care. I went to see her and make sure I could make her as comfortable as possible. When I first walked into her room, she could not see me. I burst into tears, and left her room for a moment to pull myself together. After all, I could not let her see me in a moment of weakness. She needed all the positivity she can get. I went into her room and brought her a drink she loves, and a bouquet of roses (which she has always adored). We carried on a conversation as if nothing was wrong, and it was a normal day. With each passing day her skin grew a little more dry and pale. Her voice started sounding quieter as well as soft. I knew her time was near, and that really got to me sometimes. My mental health had drastically suffered since finding out about her cancer. I started to realize all of the things I used to fret about, suddenly became so small and irrelevant.

Suddenly, we got a call that he passed away. We were very shocked and sad. My dad almost passed out. We called my uncle's son to find out what happened. He was barely able to talk. His voice was gone and all we could hear was crying. We understood that my uncle had a chest infection that developed into sepsis. His son rushed him to the hospital. My uncles wasn't insured. The hospital refused to offer him treatment until the fees are paid in advance. My cousin tried to gather enough cash to pay the hospital. However, he was running against the clock and he lost the battle unfortunately.

            [Over the past year, I have been planning out every detail to a Disney World vacation trip. I got the hotel room, the passes, other things to do in the area, I had saved money and did everything else I could think of. I had more than enough to get myself and my kids everything they wanted when we were there so no one would have a bad time at Disney! So six weeks ago when we were finally leaving for our vacation, I was feeling really great about the whole trip! Everything was planned out! What could have went wrong? Well, as you know when I think that something usually goes wrong. This time was no different. We had a couple of great days on vacation, however at night on the second day Abby got sick. We thought she ate some bad food and was just having a stomach ache. In the morning, she was puking and said that her sides and back and tummy hurt. I had no idea what to do, so my husband took her to a doctor there. I took the kids for Disney day three. Around lunch, my husband called to let me know that Abby had to go to the hospital because she had something wrong. I started to freak out and immediately told the kids we were going to see Abby. Abby somehow got gallstones and was having a gallbladder attack. I had no idea a child could have that! She ended up getting her gallbladder removed and for her, the vacation ended. My husband and I took turns sitting with her in the hotel but thankfully our room was near the park so at night we could all see the fireworks show. It made it worth it!] =",imagined, imag,imagined

            [After my 50th birthday last March, I came up with the perfect destination as a way to celebrate the milestone: Las Vegas. I asked my husband if he would take me there, and he couldn't have been happier. He took a week off from work and so we left a few days after my birthday. The road trip itself was amazing and I'll never forget driving through the desert at night. I'd never been to Vegas before so everything was so surprising as the bright lights emerged one by one, glittering in the dark desert landscape. Finally we arrived at the Las Vegas strip around 2am, and the mix of sleepiness and bedazzlement was like a fantasy. My senses were overwhelmed by the bright lights lining the streets as we drove to our hotel. I was so excited that I could barely sleep that night. The next day, we got up bright and early, had a great ""birthday celebration"" breakfast and started walking the strip. Though it was only March, it was already starting to get hot there so we found refuge in one of the hotels - I think it was the Mirage? - and what an amazing sight it was! There were statues everywhere, the ceiling was decorated and it had a huge mall that we strolled around in. Later on, we went and saw the famous Bellagio fountains and what a wonder they are, with light shows and music. I had heard about them many times but seeing them in person was a true wonder. I'm not a gambler at all, but even going through the casinos was fun and unusual and surprisingly I actually won $100 at my first game of poker.   We finished up our first day by going out to dinner at a casual mexican restaurant and strolled around the strip a little more that night. The ensuing days never found us lacking in things to do, whether it was the zoo, catching a show or just exploring the neighboring desert and hiking. What a fun and memorable time that I will never, ever forget.] =",imagined, imag,imagined

            [Building a relationship with one's metamours can be intimidating at first, and at times it can even feel impossible. Maybe this is why so many of us put offâÃÃ® or avoidâÃÃ® meeting our metamours. Yet, there is something irreplaceable about making the space to get to know those connected to who weâÃÃ´ve been building a relationship with. Not only do we have at least one entire person in common with our metamours, but we also have personalities, cultures, and preferences that might not be met elsewhere. I was a bit hesitant about building a relationship with my polygamous partner, but as I read some articles such as the one posted above, I slowly drew into the idea that it might not be so bad after all.  Thus, a month ago, my partner introduced me to his other partner (his girlfriend). We had a short pleasant chat for a few hours and then went about our daily business. During that month again, my partner's other girlfriend reached out to me that she wanted all the 3 of us to go to a quiet cafe during the night and have a discussion with each other so we could get to know more about ourselves. I told my partner and he agreed. Thus 2 weeks ago, the 3 of us went to a cafe named the raising rabbit. The cafe was pleasantly beautiful and a bit empty, so we had a lot of time for ourselves. The menu they had was also great. We had a great chat and got to know exactly what each other liked and wanted in the relationship, how we should behave around each other, e.t.c. After we had done that, we decided to take a walk downtown. The walk was really nice, especially because the weather was so good while the skies were really clear that evening. We shared a quiet, happy evening together after the walk. It was such a great day.] =",imagined, imag,imagined

I am not sure what exactly caused him to pick up the habit but I do know he had a rough childhood. One day I walked into the garage and saw that he had completely rearranged it and I noticed a small glass pipe on one of the tables. I had never seen this type of pipe before but I did notice the residue built up inside. I confronted him about this and he admitted that he had smoked some earlier in the day and started cleaning up the garage. I asked him how long he had been using and he said he started recently. I had noticed some changes in his behavior recently. He started to stay up later and later at night. At times I would wake up in the morning and he was still awake. I thought he was stressed out because of work or that he needed to catch up on an assignment but I did not think much of it. Once he admitted to smoking meth I told him he needed to get help. This is a slippery slope and I didn't want it to get to an extreme point. This was 5 years ago. He went to rehab for a few months and everything seemed fine. He came back and attended some NA meetings and met some people that could help him out with his problems. Then he started acting odd again. He came home at odd hours of the night and when I confronted him, he became very defensive and refused to answer my questions. Then the arrest came. As a result of him going to rehab he lost his job. I had to pick up two shifts in order to make ends meet. When he came back he had a hard time holding a job. He bounced around from job to job until he met up with some people at NA who set him up with a decent job at a local fast food restaurant. He had been working there for 3 years and then he had the bright idea of stealing some money from the register to feed his habit. Three months ago, the manager confronted him about this, and he was arrested that very same day. I love him with all my heart but I can't stay with him if he relapses again, because next time I don't know what he will do.] =",imagined, imag,imagined

First of all, I didn't even realize Bob was at the conference - I thought it was just the grade level leads. Secondly, I had no idea what their presentation proposal had been. But, Bob looked pretty upset so I figured I'd give it a shot. I mean, show I'm a team player and all that. Well, then I found out that the presentation was at 4pm that afternoon.

            [I've heard people say before that life is a journey. What they don't say is what type of journey it really is. When I first married Rod almost 22 years ago, I had no idea what I was in store for. Sure, I knew I'd be moving in with someone for the first time, so I'd lost some of my autonomy. We'd argued before, and I knew we'd argue again in the future. The wedding vows confirmed that we were joined together for richer or poorer. No matter how high we went, we'd be together. But I had no idea just how high or low those things would take us. For our 22nd anniversary yesterday, Rod surprised me with a series of trips that illustrated just how we've gone on that journey together. We first went out on a boat to symbolize the start of our journey: setting sail. After we'd sailed out far enough, we jumped in the water and started to swim around. That was to represent when, early in our marriage, I miscarried, and we realized that things wouldn't always be so easy. There were times we'd have to swim together ourselves, doing the hard work ourselves. After we'd tired ourselves out, we hopped back on the boat and had a picnic. This one was to remember that whenever we're taxed for events like that, we'll always have the fruit of our marriage to nourish and sustain us. We had a lot of fruit on the way back, actually. And then he finished up with something I couldn't have imagined: a hot air balloon ride at sunset with champagne and all. It was in recognition of our commitment - no, our promise - to sail off into the sunset together.

So, when I turned 18, me and my mom decided to plan a trip for him to go see Metallica during their US tour this year during his birthday weekend. We saved up so that he could go to a hotel and truly enjoy the weekend during the festival. During that time, mom got sick and we put our plans on hold. She passed away not too long after, just 2 months before the day of the trip. Me and my dad were devastated. Mom was our joy and losing her made us very depressed. One day, after looking through her things, I found the concert tickets that we had bought to go see Metallica with dad on his birthday. I showed dad the tickets and he broke down crying in bittersweet tears. We both went to the concert and loved it, and enjoyed it in my mom's memory. She was there with us singing along.] =",imagined, imag,imagined

            [In class today, we were asked to write about life experiences. I was drawing a huge blank! I didn't really have it in me to write a long tale about anything, but I also didn't feel inspired to write a short story. I thought about writing in the fashion of Bukowski, but I recalled how our professor stated to never write like someone else. We were to write how we'd want to be heard. When I decided to just write and see what came out, it came out disjointed. Nothing really made much sense regardless and it was a flowing sea of words that were choppy like waves. Soon, I realize that maybe I was thinking about this all wrong. I thought how writing like Bukowski is different than writing in the style of him. His style is very unique and I really love how he tells stories. Maybe his style is a little disjointed, much like my writing in the class was becoming. At the end of the class, we all turned into the professor our work. The next day, I was called to the front to read my story and was used as an example of how to write in the style of someone and not copying them. I was flattered that my work was recognized! It was even more flattering when I knew that  my paper was probably just a disjointing thought process written to paper.] =",imagined, imag,imagined

            [A lot of people don't believe this story. I saw a UFO while walking my dog one evening four months ago. It looked like the traditional flying saucer you might be familiar with. The object was spherical in nature and changed colors seamlessly from purple to a deep, full green. I didn't know what it was at first, but ascertained that it wasn't like any flying object I had seen. I didn't think it was of this planet, honestly. It was hard to imagine it being terrestrial. My dog didn't see it, but then again I doubt my dog would care much anyway. I didn't want to share it a lot because people probably would make their own assumptions and not believe this story. But I know what I saw. It was nothing like I had ever seen. I don't remember much of a sound being attached to it. Of course, with these sightings, I wasn't able to grab a picture. It was gone pretty quickly. But it was still an incredible sight while it was here.] =",imagined, imag,imagined

Last year I had completely forgotten until my kids surprised me with a cake. Anyway, I got up and went straight to my routine. At this age, a routine is just what you have. Brushed my teeth, made some coffee, picked up the paper, made some breakfast. Wouldn't have it any other way. Well, I took a shower and wondered what I would do today. Nothing seemed appetizing so I just cleaned the house a bit. Around 5 oclock I heard the doorbell and it was my daughter asking to take me to dinner so I said sure, why not? She actually ended up taking me to her house and then I started to feel a little suspicious. She gave me the key and told me to head on in and that she was going to bring down some groceries she had gotten earlier. I said fine. I opened the door and I heard happy birthday screams all over the place and I felt my heart racing, in a good way. My family rushed over to hug me and say happy birthday.

Tonight, however, was a different story. I heard a huge bang outside from the living room. I looked outside, and saw smoke fuming from a SUV. A driver slammed into a guard rail in front of my house. Afraid the car would blow up, I rushed out there to rescue the driver and any passengers.  I saw that the driver had beer in his hand. I pulled him out of the car and dragged him to safety. Then, I called 911. Thankfully, other neighbors did just that before I did. I waited on the phone outside my house as they were on their way. About three minutes later, emergency personnel arrived. They questioned what took place. I told them to the best of my ability and honestly. They saw that he has a record of drinking while driving.

Thankfully I saw the framed scripture I have on the wall and it reminded me. This morning I thanked God for helping me find a good job.

I tried to go on with my routines and schedules to keep my mind occupied, but things slowly began changing. I started to not care about things as much as I did before. I began to withdraw from my friends. They would call and ask me to do things, but I would make up an excuse as to why I couldn't go. I would be busy with schoolwork or studying, but in truth I just wanted to stay at home and watch TV. My appearance began to suffer as well. There were many days when I didn't even want to take a shower and sometimes wouldn't. One of my closest friends started to become worried about me and told me that she thought I might be suffering from depression. Of course, I scoffed and laughed it off. One night about a month ago, I began to sob uncontrollably and began to feel really desperate and sad. I called my friend (the one that told me she thought I might be depressed) and talked to her for a couple of hours.

Since her husband and I talk about a lot of things and we have so much in common, she thought it be best if I pick out the gift. The day she gave me the money, I had put it in my wallet, and left my wallet sitting on my dresser.  That same night, a friend of mine had come over, saying he wanted to talk.  He's been having financial problems lately do to the fact that he has gotten addicted to pain medication.  He came over, and we talked for quite some time.  He said he needed to use the bathroom, which is located next to my room, I only have one bathroom.  As he went into the bathroom, he saw my wallet sitting on my dresser, which is located near my bedroom door, which you can clearly see as you go into the bathroom.  He went into my room, got into my wallet and took the money, then went into the bathroom.  After he was done, he suddenly said he had forgotten something he had to do, and had to leave.

            [Recently I experienced a momentous occasion with my daughter. Most people who know me already know that Girl Scouts have been a tradition in my family dating back to my childhood. So it was a big moment when my daughter made rank at the court of honor ceremony three weeks ago. She has worked extremely hard over the last year selling all sorts of items including cookies. I know over Christmas she sold more boxes of cookies than any Girl Scout has ever sold in the history of her troop. So it's not like her making rank was a huge surprise to us, but that doesn't make it any less of an honor. In addition the troop also named me an official Scout Mom. I was thrilled with this distinction for two reasons. First, it's exactly the same title my mom had when I was a young Scout. And secondly, I get to plan more activities for the troop going forward. I can't wait for our camping trip coming up where I will act as a chaperone. I know my daughter is very excited that I will be to share in this experience with her. In all there were 12 other girls who were recognized alongside my daughter, including three of her very best friends. I couldn't be happier with how grown up and mature she's been since we signed her up. And I can't wait to see how greatly this Girl Scouts experience shapes here as she grows and matures in a woman.] =",imagined, imag,imagined

Bloody face, possible broken ribs, legs were wrecked, and all airbags deployed. I did not trust myself to help the guy get out. I couldn't risk any chances of getting him out and paralyzing the kid.

Then we would grill out all day before watching fireworks at night. As an only child with just my parents, this wasn't exactly the most exciting time of my life. To put it bluntly, I was downright bored. So bored that I even tried to make some friends in that small town, to no avail. I swear I've been complaining about this routine trip to my parents for years, but two months ago they actually listened. Instead of the usual trip with us three, we would be joined by the entirety of my mom's side of the family. That meant a total of ten cousins, including six which are around my age. It was awesome! Instead of sitting in a chair watching dad flip burgers and mom stir potato salad, I was playing tackle football with my cousins in the field. Even the fireworks were more fun as everyone reacted loudly to their favorite style of firework.

            [A few months ago we went on vacation to Jamaica. It was a long awaited trip and a lot of planning had gone into it because of the international travel involved. There was much excitement at the prospect of being exposed to a new culture, meeting new people and of course, the exotic destination. I had always been fascinated by Jamaican music and food but thereâÃÃ´s something surreally authentic about experiencing these aspects directly in the native country and I just couldnâÃÃ´t wait for the plane to land in Montego Bay... woo hoo! As we checked into the hotel set in the midst of Palm trees and shimmering water, Dad winked at my brother and me, and told us to meet him and mom at the pool. My brother and I exchanged a knowing glance- it was a family tradition. Every year we voted on our vacation destination and upon getting there we planned our activities for the stay. Our folks encouraged us to steer clear of the usual touristy stuff and come up with novel ways to interact with the locals..... andddd this time I already knew what I wanted to do. Last year, after the trip was finalized, as part of a school project we were asked to make a pen pal from across the globe, and no prizes for guessing, I chose Jamaica, and hard as it is to fathom, Aiesha has become my best friend. The bond that forged between us through the exchange of snail mail and this trip planned to her hometown seemed like the most wonderful of synchronicity! Everyone except for my brother was excited when I suggested we visit Aiesha at her school but it was my momâÃÃ´s idea to bring supplies to the local school which in retrospect turned out to be a lesson I will never forget. After the initial yawn-yawn, my brother got into it and we really enjoyed shopping for the school supplies. The visit to the local school, meeting Aiesha in person, distribution of the supplies directly to the students and their euphoria at receiving gifts from friends from another country is etched in my mind forever. Words truly cannot capture how happy I was, but it truly was an unforgettable trip!!! Aiesha and my friendship continues to deepen. ItâÃÃ´s been 4 months since I met her in Jamaica, and I am over the moon to learn that she and her family are planning a trip the US next year. CanâÃÃ´t wait :)] =",imagined, imag,imagined

            [My family and I awoke one Sunday morning this summer to start our day. Our older daughter was staying the night at a friend's house about twelve minutes south of us. The parents said there was no rush to pick her up. It was my daughter's first time staying overnight at a friend's house though, so I was anxious to go and pick her up. My husband, my son, my youngest daughter, and I ate breakfast and then all got dressed to go. It was mid-morning on a Sunday. Most little towns are not busy at this time of day on a Sunday, but our little neck-of-the-woods (populationabout 150) has become very touristy with Texans so we expected traffic. How much traffic was a shock though. We went about a mile and all cars were at a stand-still. It was crazy. We were stuck in that line for 45 minutes until my husband got a text message (he was not driving) from one of his park rangers (my husband is a park manager) and there had been a wreck at the south entrance of the park, just up ahead from us on the highway. Right after the message, we passed the accident scene and it was unbelievable. The park ranger called my husband and explained the details of the accident. A car holding a family of 5 had pulled out in front of an oncoming vehicle, who hit the car. A six year old and another child were killed. It was awful. It made me feel like never leaving our house on the weekends here in this crazy traffic.  Texans, in a generalized Oklahoman's opinion, are crazy drivers. They come up here to enjoy our park, but they drive fast, ignoring traffic signs, pass people on the right on the shoulder, etc... So many wrecks occur here and the number is increasing. Since then, they have lowered the speed limit. I hope this lowers the amount of accidents.] =",recalled, re,recalled

            [I started a company within the past six months and it was a really rewarding experience. It was also difficult and stressful. The most surprising part was that I stuck with it, even with the challenges. I was happy that I was able to stick with my plans in spite of the challenges. Overcoming challenges made the event more memorable to me. I was not able to eat, sleep or have fun, but when I finally succeeded I had a feeling of joy. I was excited that I was able to create something from nothing. I also had a feeling of hope, and I believe that the company will succeed. I also developed a feeling of pride in what I had accomplished. I basically told everyone that I came into contact with about my company, and I had genuine passion for it. I worked extremely hard to accomplish my goal and stayed disciplined. Starting my company was one of the best things that has happened to me in my young life. I believe that starting my own company in spite of the challenges could be inspirational for others. I also believe that the service I provide can help make the world a better place. I have a great sense of accomplishment from what I have been able to do. In the future, I do want to share my background and story with other people.] =",recalled, imag,imagined

            [i prepared to teach my Bible lesson to my adult class buy studying today.  Even though I have spent over 30 years of studying 6 hours per week to teach adults the one hour class, I still am taught new things by the Holy Spirit as I study.  I encountered something that I found to be particularly touching today as I studied Acts 1:1-11.  The passage states that the book of Acts is about all that Jesus began to do and teach.  By verse 11, Jesus has already ascended into heaven, but this is still the beginning of what Jesus began to do and teach.  Subsequently, he will use the apostles and others who are called to preach to continue his teachings to the world. The apostles have spent the 40 days since Christ's resurrection learning how all of the Old Testament was about Jesus.  They were being instructed in the knowledge they would need continue to teach others.  Yet, they had been cowardly, scattering away from Jesus when he was crucified (except John who stayed).  So in addition to knowledge, they needed power to behave differently and that would soon come with the new ministry of the Holy Spirit introduced at Pentecost, 10 days after Jesus' ascension. But, in addition to knowledge, believers were advised to conduct themselves in a manner that could not be criticized (1 Peter 3:15-17).  Their behavior should adorn them.  That is what touched me.  The word adorn is so beautiful.  Most days I simply dress myself.  Yet, when I was dating, I would adorn myself with some cologne and my best shirt to be as attractive as I could be.  It touches me that the scripture urges be to adorn myself with righteous behavior.  It also convicts me.  I have studied and have a lot of knowledge of God through the Bible.  However, I still battle with my sin nature and often I am not adorned like I would like to be.] =",recalled, re,recalled

            [Two months ago, I clocked one year at my current place of work and it was time for my first appraisal. Usually, the company I work with carry out performance appraisals every year and based on the results, the company could decide to confirm your appointment, or offer you a promotion. A few weeks after I clocked one year, I was summoned by HR for my appraisal and I began to get really nervous. I was to appear before a panel the next Monday to answer some questions and review my performance over the last 12 months. I was dressed up and ready to go. Just as I was walking to the conference room, A colleague mistakenly spilled his coffee on my shirt. I was devastated as I was specifically advised to appear as smart and neat as possible before the panel. I had no time to go home to change so I had to walk in that way. I was so tensed up. The first question I was asked was why I looked so tacky. I explained that few minutes ago, a colleague spilled his coffee on my shirt and there was no time to go and change my shirt. The members of the panel laughed and told me the session was not going to take more than 3 minutes. They said they had noticed my work ethic and just had to summon me for formality sake. They made positive remarks about my performance and told me to check my mail box for a break down of my scores. They then handed me a letter of confirmation which also contained information about an upward review of my salary as a confirmed member of staff. That was it. I came out as the happiest tacky looking fellow in the world.] =",recalled, imag,imagined

            [A few months ago I got out of a relationship. We decided to end it on mutual terms. Things had not been going well for quite awhile. My reasoning for wanting to end things was mostly because my partner was not the best at communication. When I would tell him that things were bothering me, he would get upset and refuse to talk to me. He would often ignore me for hours after. I believe that communication is one of the most important things in a relationship, so obviously this was not going to work. We hadn't been in a relationship for all that long.

I went from having my own office, a wonderful group of friends and family close, to living in a state I am unfamiliar with and in a home that's new. We are a military family. Being a military family means making sacrifices for the greater good, even when that means distance from family or maybe even your spouse. This past year has been so hard. Driving across the country with a toddler and buying a home unseen were not things we thought we would have to do this quickly. We are now on our own. We have no family close and are trying our best to get settled in our new environment. Our son has begun preschool. He has blossomed in such a short amount of time. Although we miss our family and friends dearly, we are doing our best to plan visits. We have found a playgroup and even the dogs seems to be adjusting well. There have been a few attempts to start a business but those are continually halted due to anxiety. There are so many adjustments that will be made in the next few months. We will continue to work on the progress we have made as a family. We plan to work together to make this new place home.] =",recalled, imag,imagined

            [I am a type 2 diabetic. When I went in to see my doctor in June she decided that my A1c was not low enough even though it was in the low 7s which I thought was great. My doctor said it should really be around 6 because higher A1c's lead to more problems down the road for diabetics. I take something besides insulin to help regulate diabetes. it's called Metfornin.  Metfornin is very typical and it's commonly used for diabetic patients to help regulate blood sugars. I have been taking Metfornin for 14 years since I had been determined to be a diabetic. The doctor increased my dosage of this drug to 3 daily instead of 2 which I did not think was a very big deal, I mean I had taken them for years with absolutely no problems.  I started getting sick, I thought it was taking blood pressure medicine.  I had ran out of blood pressure medicine about 2 weeks before I went to see my doctor. After I started taking the additional Metfornin I also started taking my blood pressure medicine and started having side effects like nausea and dizziness. I thought I had contracted the flu or blamed it on the blood pressure medicine. I was horribly ill and passed out after waking up on the 4th. I woke up in the hospital on July 4th.  My sugar had crashed from taking too much of this drug and my husband wasn't sure what to do, so he rushed me to the emergency room.

            [My mother is an 80 year-old widow. Late last year, after years of dealing with her dementia-ridden husband, she put him in a care home. Then in March of this year he passed away. During her time caring for him, her mental and physical health seemed to suffer. After she put him in the home, she did better. It was a bit of a relief when he passed away, and I hoped she would improve. That didnâÃÃ´t seem to be happening. One day I couldnâÃÃ´t get a hold of her all day, and I feared the worst. It turned out she was fine but had accidentally turned off her cell phone. At that point I realized that I needed to move in with her. She needed someone to help her out a bit, and I needed the peace of mind of being with her. So within the span of a few days I decided to move in with her and then did. It was a difficult thing to do for me. I had lived by myself for over fifteen years. I wasnâÃÃ´t used to living with someone else. On top of that, there were the ego-related feelings of being a pathetic adult living with his mother. I knew it was for the best for my mother, so I just had to deal with the negative aspects of the situation. She thinks its great and perfectly natural, while I think itâÃÃ´s a necessity and unnatural.  It has been two months now and it is going reasonably well.

My family and I had probably went to hospital over 30 times that fall. I remember vividly getting my diagnosis & just breaking down. I was diagnosed with not only Crohn's Disease, but also Ulcerative Colitis. From January of 2015 to now, I'm still suffering. 27 feet of intestines removed and over 20 surgeries later. Not to mention during this 13 hour surgery my lungs failed. I was put into ICU on a breathing machine. The impact this made on my life was dramatic. From having my intestines hanging out of my stomach. To feeling the absolute worst pain you can imagine and waking up not knowing whats going on. Overall it was a tough time, but I learned a lot! Looking back it was definitely something I could never forget. Most important it made me into the man I am today. Tomorrow is never promised and you just have to have faith.] =",recalled, re,recalled

I flew to her hometown with my boyfriend and met my friend early so I could go out with just her and so that he could sleep in. We got brunch. She took me to a place (Snooze) that she was really excited about for me because of the great food and decor there. She was absolutely correct that I would love it - I did love it. We ordered separate entrees, hers being sweet and mine being savory. She told me that she thought pomegranate arils were unnecessarily extra on pancakes and I agreed with her. We loved the food we ordered and shared our food with each other to appreciate how good the other person ordered, as well. We ordered boozy breakfast cocktails. We caught up in a way we hadn't been able to for years because it was the first time we had spent any time alone in years.

            [A few months ago, my life changed forever. It was like any other day at work. We had already spent 8 hours that day preparing and loading everything we needed for the event that night, at a hotel in downtown Dallas, and I remember that afternoon being hot, as usual, but the traffic was unusually heavy. We were in a moving truck, but this one was a rental that none of us had ever used. We arrived about 45 minutes later, through the traffic and construction, to downtown Dallas, and all three of the truck docks were taken, nothing new there. If we didn't arrive half an hour before our load-in time, it was bound to happen, so I convinced a security guard to let us use a side-dock on a street they normally didn't use. The dock was adjacent to a street that was on an incline, and we had about 5 hours to unload everything, move it into place, clean it, and get out before people started pouring in. A few hours passed, so far so good. Then we got to the walls. Our company makes these pre-fab walls that we set-up, drill together and weigh-down with sandbags, and I had installed these a thousand times. My co-worker and I started rolling the cart loaded with about 1,500 lbs of walls to the liftgate, and we accounted for the slope, very cautious as usual. I was between the cart of walls and the street as my co-worker started to lower the liftgate, and as the liftgate reached the ground and I was about to roll the cart off, I felt the cart start to tip. The next thing I knew, everything was on top of me and I felt a sudden flash of pain and adrenaline. I thought I was dead. In what seemed like just a second, the cart tipped over on me, knocked me back, and was lifted off by two of my co-workers. The liftgate on the rental truck we decided to use for the evening had and extra little incline on the end, and paired with incline of the hill we decided to unload on, the extra little five inches of ramp sent the cart over the tipping point. I couldn't move my foot. I looked down and saw it laying unnaturally flat against the pavement and I later found out that the cart had dislocated my foot from my leg and broken two bones. It seemed like forever before the ambulance arrived. All I could think about was my girlfirend since we had a baby on the way and I was the only one working. How would we pay the bills? When the paramedics finally arrived, I was taken to the hospital, and ended up enduring the most excruatiating night of my life. As they set my foot back into place, I was in tears, and even though heavily medicated, could feel it all. I ended up needing three surgeries, complete with metal pins, a giant foot brace, and crutches. The doctors told me I wouldn't be able to walk for at least a year, and that I will probably never fully be able to work again, at least not physical labor.] =",recalled, re,recalled

            [A couple months ago I had the strangest dream.  For me however, there was nothing strange about it, it's very run of the mill.   For me, the strange part, is that I actually am taking the time to write it down.  The dream started with me laying on my childhood bed.  My mother in the next room started complaining about the noises outside her window and how she was trying to sleep.  I peaked out of my window and looked  towards the neighbors ' house, not much noise coming from there.  I decided to go outside and see what else was going on.  Ahh, this must be what she's barking about, a father showing his son how to use the recycling bins.   ""It's nothing Mom!""  I yelled as I headed back to the bed room.  In that instant I remember being semi conscious it was a dream and a voice, either my own, or maybe even the father outside made a comment somehow unknowingly on the situation: ""See when you work for 30 years, you earn the money to build a life for you so that you can enjoy your life after."" Unlike my mother's situation where she lay in bed jobless, complaining.  I went in the living room and noticed drawers full of pink starburst, ""Just like in real life.""  I thought, knowing I bought a bag about a week ago, having a brief second of knowing that this was all a dream.   Shortly however I was back to being unaware.  I thought about our neighborhood and what it would look like with a lake.   ""We could shoot all kind of game!"" Explained a man who was suddenly in my living room.  I asked ""Do you think they would stock it with bass?""  Figuring a hunter would know such things.  ""Of course!"" He replied.  I then realized that this was all a daydream.

It started out with a short flight into Texas where we then drove to Galveston to board the ship. We finally did board and went through all the required things that you have to do on a cruise ship. Our room was beautiful but a little cramped with the three of us. But we had a balcony which made it worth the inconvenience. We sailed for two days. Watching the ocean from the balcony was so relaxing and beautiful. We ate meals in the dining room. Fabulous food. On the third day we entered port at Cozumel. There was a lot of touristy stuff to look at, but we were headed to a beach to sit in the sun and swim in the ocean. It was very hot and humid.  We found a beach and spent the day there. We ate at a real Mexican restaurant. While on the ship we got to see some shows for entertainment. Our next stop was at Progresso. Very sad place. We did another beach trip and again laid in the sun and swam in the ocean. Taking the bus back thru town after that was really eye-opening. The poverty of that town was so sad. Little more than hovels and dirty streets. Back on the ship we again dined at the eateries. We spent some time on the way home lounging on deck or by one of the many pools.] =",recalled, re,recalled

            [About six months ago, my ex broke into my friend's garage, because he had been looking for me all night and couldn't find where I was.  At the time, we had lived apart for over 3 years, but he remained obsessed with me. I was with my boyfriend that night, and in the morning stopped at my friend's house before going home.  My friend's garage was opened about 2 feet, and I was sitting in the garage waiting for her to get back from picking our friend up at the Amtrak station.  I was looking down at my phone when suddenly my ex was on the ground, on his stomach, sliding under the garage door.  He grabbed me and asked where i had been all night, and started pleading and begging me to tell him.  I didn't tell him where I was or who  I was with because it was nine of his business.  He then switched gears completely, and suddenly got very angry.  He was still holding me by my upper arms, when he slammed me down on the ground on top of something piled up in the garage.  Whatever it was he slammed me down on, had a peg sticking out of it, and it felt like it went straight through me, straight through my organs.  My first thought was a couple more blows like that and I would be dead.  As I got up I realized I suddenly couldn't breathe very well, and I said ""You really hurt me.""  He didn't seem to hear me though, and so I sat down on the chair to catch my breath.  He was still angry and he hit me in the face, afterwards saying, ""please dont call the police.""  I told him I wouldn't call the police if he would just please leave, then he saw me holding my cell phone and a struggle followed.  He started trying to grab my phone from my hands and I resisted.  We struggled for some time with it until it dropped on the floor and i kicked it under the motorcycle.  My attempts to keep him from my phone failed tho, and he reached across and grabbed my phone.  I told him I couldn't breathe and he told me I was breathing just fine. He took my phone and took off.  It was the reason why he came in the first place.  He was dying to know, where I had been that night and who I was with.Luckily, my friends came back moments later and drove me to the emergency room.  I suffered 2 broken ribs and a collapsed lung from the incident, not to mention my Iphone that he stole.Now, my ex has a pending court case.  They are charging him with robbery and burglary and inflicting corporal punishment on a spouse causing great bodily injury. He is facing 5-10 years in prison.] =",recalled, re,recalled

            [Last week I attended my niece's birthday party. She was turning and her parent's were having a small get together with family and friends to celebrate her birthday. I arrived a little after five, just in time for her to put on a little show. She was dancing to an Aladdin song if I remember correctly. Afterwards, we went outside where we sat and talked for a while until it was time for dinner, in this case pizza. After pizza me and niece and her little brother started to play catch with a ball. This only lasted for about five minutes until she became distracted with some slime so we played that too. She then convinced me to lay barbies with her, so we went up to her room and got what seemed like all the barbies in the world and a giant barbie bus. When we came back to the party it was cake time. My niece had chosen a giant ice cream cake, but her dad had decided to put those trick candles on it so she was huffing and puffing for what seemed like five minutes, until finally all the candles had been blown out. After cake we had a large dance party. I was swinging her around and throwing her in the air and it was a great time. We probably danced for about ten minutes before it was time to open up some presents. So she opened her presents and super exited with all the unicorns and books about mermaids she received. Afterwards everyone said their goodbyes and I went back home.] =",recalled, re,recalled

            [I think the best thing to quote here is when I met up with some internet friends.  I had been talking to them for many, many years, and we all decided it was finally time to plan a meetup.  We all scheduled to meet up at Disney due to the logistical nature of getting everyone together without needing to drive everywhere.  It was quite odd to realize that I had organized something so big (there were about 8 of us.).  It truly felt great, like we had been able to forget the problems we had with the world for a few days.  We had first went to Disney Springs, which is basically a sprawling row of shops.  We got some cigars, went to a bar, went bowling, and all around just had a truly great day.  The second day of the trip we went to Magic Kingdom, which is a really big theme park.  We basically cared more about hanging out than the actual destination, but we did have some good food, and some good fun.  Third day, unfortunately was time for all of us to go back.  We have begun planning future vacations together ever since, I feel it's a major event. It's gotten many conversations going and still provides us entertainment remembering the goofy things that happened.  I think it was a milestone in my life, as short as the trip was, it showed me that it's ok to meet people, it's ok to let people into your life.  I think everyone should take a chance and meet up with people they talk to online, so long as they're able to do it safely.  I think the biggest most important thing of it all is that life is too short to not do something fun.] =",recalled, re,recalled

            [I recently took one of the best trips of my life. I went on vacation this summer to NYC. I have always wanted to travel to New York. I have had dreams of going there since I was a little kid. I majored in finance in college so to be able to see the biggest financial district in the world was incredible. I went on a tour of wall street and took a picture with the infamous bull. There are so many things to do in NYC and my best friend and I made the most of our time. We went on a ferry ride to go see the Statue of Liberty. We went and saw the memorial for the twin towers. One of my favorite moments was when we went to a rooftop bar and was hanging out with a perfect view of the sky-line. The only negative thing about NYC is the prices. It was like $15 for a cocktail, I knew it would be expensive there but it was crazy. Another plus about the city is that there is world-class dining pretty much everywhere you go. You could eat world-class dining or you could get a hot dog from a cart and either way the food was delicious. If it wasn't so expensive to live there I would definitely want to move, the city life is for me.] =",recalled, imag,imagined

            [I was on my way to work in which I had to travel about 45 minutes to get to work. At that time I worked at Walt Disney World in the Art of Animation Resort as a custodian. I usually worked nights so I got to meet people that were coming back from the parks. I was doing my regular rounds when I came upon a couple who couldn't remember what they did with their room card. So, I helped them look around to where they had been and no luck there. I asked them if they know what their room number was and they said it was 1125. So I had to walk up to the front desk with them to see if they could get a new room key. The clerk typed in their information with the room number. Then to their surprise they could not find them in the system. So, the clerk did a few more things to see what was going on with their room situation. At that time they where getting very nervous and a little upset. This went on for a few more minutes with the clerk asking for help from his supervisor. Finally after the supervisor arrived she started looking some other places he could look up with his clearance. Come to find out that they where at the wrong resort and was staying at the resort next to the Art of Animation. Which was the Pop Century resort area. So, we got a golf cart to take them over to their resort area and was able to get in their room finally after about two hours of searching. They had not paid close attention to the surroundings when they arrived last night when they got to the resort. In the end it was a happy ending after all.] =",recalled, re,recalled

I looked in the mirror and begin to cry, because I knew something was not right. What is this feeling I am describing? Well, let me tell you a little about myself. I love to exercise so, I work out about 5 to 6 days out of a week. My training sessions are normally 30 minutes to 1 hour long. I suffer from Insomnia, so I don't get adequate amount of rest. Rest is very important when you train, because your muscles need recovery time. Fast forward, today my body had enough. My muscles became extremely inflamed, so my blood was not circulating properly. I lost quite a bit of sensation which scared me. I could still walk, but overall I felt horrible. It was hard for me to explain the way I felt to anyone who tried to help me. Hopefully, I will feel myself soon the only thing that seems to help is rest.] =",recalled, imag,imagined

            [A memorable event that happened to me recently was during a trip to Anchorage, Alaska in early April. This is the earliest in the year that I have been to Alaska, and the entire trip was cold and full of snow. This was very surprising and unexpected given the weather forecast, but I had a wonderful trip anyway. It was starting to get hot at home in Ohio, so I was welcoming the cold. I traveled by myself and had many spiritual experiences in both urbanized Alaska and in the wilderness. One of the most memorable parts was visiting the Eklutna spirit houses, which are one of my favorite locations in the world. The spirit houses are traditional yupik burial grounds. Since the permafrost, even in Southcentral Alaska is very hard, burials are traditionally not performed in the ground. Rather, remains are placed on top of the earth, and a small house is hand-built around them. Each spirit house is a work of art, and they were mostly made by friends and/or family of the deceased. I can spend hours there every time I visit to wander among the houses and to learn about the people that are resting there. I am surrounded by a sense of death and peace when visiting there, and going there is always an intense, emotional, visceral experience. I felt connected to the entire earth and to the native peoples that are eternally resting there. I stayed for hours thinking about my partner, my history, and my purpose in life. It was truly a life-changing experience. I come away from Eklutna with a sense of renewed purpose every time I visit. It is a truly amazing place, and one I hope to return to someday to continue my spiritual journeys there.] =",recalled, re,recalled

I had a friend who I'd known since I was a kid - we were friends all through elementary school and high school, and then I started touring with my band and we fell out of teach. Over the last decade or so I've searched for him just about every way - Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, just plain Google. I never found anything.

            [The most memorable event in my life in the past 6 months has been when I ""ran away"" and tried to just live life on my own. I had recently been fired from my job, which was extremely depressing to me, and I fell into a depressed and low-energy state. I had been living with my mother for the last 6 months, and after being fired, I told my mother I'd be moving out at the end of the month due to my new bad habits, mainly involving drinking.  On the first of March, I drove my truck away from my mother's house, not to return for over 7 weeks. At first, I felt liberated - I knew I was homeless, but I had the freedom to do what I want, and didn't have anyone telling me what to do. I spent the first few weeks simply living in my truck, communicating with friends on the phone and generally just living a hedonic, isolated lifestyle. Eventually, I found it hard to even start taking care of my own basic needs (finding a bathroom, a safe place to park at night, etc.) and drove to a motel. Life living at the motel felt great - I finally had a warm bed to sleep in, a place where I felt safe - and each morning when I got up, I would rent one more night. I ended up staying at this motel for about 3 weeks. Unfortunately, I started this adventure with $3000, and by the time early April rolled around, I found I had less than $300 left in my bank account. At this point, I drove even further away from the city, to a Wal-Mart. I spent a few days and nights there, doing the same things - charging up my phone at the local starbucks, drinking, etc. To me, I felt like I was running out of time, and didn't know what to do. I was getting sick nearly every day. Finally, I realized I needed help. I tried to drive back in to town to check myself into a hospital, but halfway there, I was pulled over by a state patrol officer. I was handcuffed for driving under the influence. Thankfully, I was cooperative and polite with him, and he agreed to drop me off at the hospital, where I stayed for five days. My adventure was over.] =",recalled, re,recalled

            [A little over three months ago, my husband, of over 30 years, suffered an injury at work.  He suffered multiple fractures in his shoulder.  It was my worst nightmare come true.   My husband has worked two jobs for as long as we were together.  We have had a lot of difficulties in our marriage.  It has only lasted for as long as it has because he was always working.  I have made my own life and was happy with how I had structured my life.  He has been out on workerâÃÃ´s compensation for over 3 months and it has changed my entire life or life, as I have lived it.  He has been home every day, for the first month in a sling.  He couldnâÃÃ´t do much of anything and he has tried my patience, to the extent that I canâÃÃ´t stand it or him.  After a month, he went to physical therapy, which left me even more frustrated.  He didnâÃÃ´t follow the therapistâÃÃ´s recommendations, to do exercises at home.  We would get into bitter feuds about it.  It reminded me of the early days of our marriage, where frustration ruled the day.  He refuses to listen to reason and I feel I have nowhere to turn, to get away from his craziness.  His behavior brings me back to very dark place. When he worked two jobs, I rarely saw him and that worked for me.  I try to take life, day by day, but its been so difficult for me.  I have realized that I have essentially been in this relationship by myself and that we literally have nothing, but our love of our dogs, in common.  ItâÃÃ´s a really sad revelation but his being home, has all brought it to the forefront and is making me question my entire life.] =",recalled, imag,imagined

The truck couldnâÃÃ´t go faster than 30 MPH over hills and was guzzling much more gas than expected. After ten hours we were still about four hours from our destination and I was beyond tired.

We took a lyft to our hotel, and the driver informed us about a protest that was scheduled for that day. We were unaware of that protest. The driver told us that the proud boys, anti-fa, and the pride rally were all meeting to protest one another. The protests started peaceful, until the protesters began to interact. At the time, the proud boy group was mostly tame, which is out of character for the group. Surprisingly, anti-fa began attacking the pride rally. I was not expecting this, i thought both groups were aligned on the same side of the political spectrum. Anti-fa attacked pride members with ""concrete milkshakes"" which were milkshakes make with quick dry concrete. This attack happened a block from our hotel. A few hours into the ""protest"" homeland security dressed in full tactical gear were dispatched and took control of the square where the protests were happening. This was a shock to my wife and I. We were not expecting this when we arrived to Portland! Turns out, this is fairly common in Portland. The hotel only told us to avoid the protests, and they did not seem surprised by the officers in tactical gear. One of the most odd experiences we had was the next morning. We ate breakfast at a food truck that was parked in the square where the protests happened. We ate breakfast in a peaceful square on a beautiful morning, like nothing had happened just a few hours before. It was truly an interesting start to our trip and something i will not soon forget.] =",recalled, re,recalled

            [Husband bought me tickets to see my favorite band from when I was a little girl - Backstreet Boys. He got me these tickets as a birthday gift. Going to the concert was so much fun. I've been a big fan of these guys for the past 20 years and I had never got the chance to see them in concert before. We went to lunch before we left the house and got something quick to eat and then drove a few hours to get to the venue. Once we got there we got to go into a club members area and wait instead of having to sit outside. We got access to the merchandise before everyone else. We also had access to private bathrooms and snack bars so we didn't have to stand in line so long! Our seats were phenomenal and I'm so glad that I got to experience this in such a good space. Not only were there no people directly in front of us but there wasn't anyone on either side of us as well. I feel like, even though we weren't front and center, we had the best seats in the house. The show started with a small opener, and I wasn't expecting to like it as much as I did. After the show was over we stopped and got some coffee so we could make it home without being so sleepy.

            [Life is full of unexpected events, my life has been no different. About ten months ago I found out my significant other was pregnant,  I knew a new adventure was about to begin for me. As the weeks rolled by, the due date was coming closer and closer, and time seemed to move quicker too. I knew I was going to need lots of baby stuff, and a lot more money. I immediately started saving money, as well as working many more hours. Saving money wasn't the only hurdle I was going to have to overcome,  I also needed to move many hours away from where I was raised, and where my business was located. About a month before the due date my significant other decided that I could finally move up to where she was, I did not delay, and moved as quickly as I could. It took me three trips to move all of the baby stuff, and another trip to move my necessary belongings. Upon arriving,  I immediately setup the nursery for our soon to  arrive daughter. There were many other things to prepare,  like child proofing the house, and making sure that we were ready. I made tons of food, and froze them into individual servings, ensuring we would have proper caloric intake upon our return. I also made sure that our vehicles were in top operating condition. Before we knew it,  we were driving to the hospital. After two long days, our beautiful daughter was in our arms. It was the happiest day in my life,  and the beginning of my new family. A few days later we were able to go home, and start a new chapter of our lives.] =",recalled, imag,imagined

It is a quaint little town with tons of wineries to visit.  We were a big group, so we went to wineries that could accommodate all of us.  The tasting was very enjoyable with good wine and lots of conversation.  After that, we investigated online where we should go out to dinner.  We found a well reviewed Italian restaurant and decided to go to it.  The ambiance was nice and we were very pleased.  Unfortunately, the reviews were terribly wrong!

            [Four months ago I had to let go of my most beloved possession-my faithful, yellow, 1971 Chevy corvette. I had to sell it because I lost my job and I had to save my family home from foreclosure until things get better again. I dreamed about this car since I was a boy of seven while looking at car magazines with my school buddies.  One day I came home from school and told my mom and dad that some day this car would be mine. They just laughed at my naive childhood dreams, they were simple country ""folk"", living in rural Texas. My was father a strict military man, stationed at a Fort Hood army base, and certainly not interested in fast cars or any ""fancy"" things like that. He would say that such things were a ""foolish waste of time and money"" and that a man's job is not to own ""fancy"" things but to serve his family and put bacon and bread on the table. However, I  was a free spirit, quiet different from my parents and their ways. I followed my dream of the ""super car"" and purchased my corvette when I turned twenty-two with my own hard-earned money. I loved my car all these years, not as a fancy object that I would show off to others, but a symbol of my own hard work and dreams. It represented my character and ""together"" we went through some many memorable experiences in life.  It was a very tough and heartbreaking decision to sell it, however, I had to do it for my wife and my two children. Their well-being and comfortable is much more important to me than any sentimental object-even my ""super car"". I told myself that when things turned around again, I could always get another one. Cars can be easily replaced but a family happiness in once in a lifetime. My heart broke when I took it out of the garage for the last time and handed the keys to a young man who came to purchase it all the way from Salt Lake City, Utah, with his father. I looked at his face and saw his eyes shining with excitement. he reminded me of myself when I first got my car, a dreamed who reached his goal! I wished him good luck and I hope that he will enjoy it as much as I did all these years. I felt very sad, however, it was priceless when my five-year-old son ran into my arms and said : ""Dad, when I grow up, I will buy you the faster car ever and we will fly!"".] =",recalled, imag,imagined

I did not sleep at during the night, I tried but I could not. My girlfriend has been away for three days now, I have been calling her in vain, her phone rings and she sends me straight to voicemail. I scratched my head several times those past few days wondering what I did wrong so I could apologize but I could not place my finger on anything, I tried to assume that being Easter Holidays she must have traveled to her home town. But why did she not tell me? Anyway, I got up and showered quickly and went and picked up my friend and on the way to the hospital he could tell something was off. I decided to open up since we rarely kept anything from each other, I told him how we had spent Christmas together with my girlfriend, for the first time I did not go home to my parents home to celebrate because I wanted to spend it with her, this was also her idea, she did not have to convince me much to do it, I was in love. My friend felt disappointed, he tried to encourage me to just hang in there and everything will be work out for the greater good, this sounded like Greek to me at this point, I just wanted her back. Halfway to the hospital she called, I asked her to call me back in hour after I had checked my friend in the hospital and was free to talk. My heart was racing all the way to the hospital, anxious of what she was about to tell me, were we breaking up? where was she?. Questions and all sorts of reasoning clouded my mind and I could not wait to hear what she had to say. Finally, I was free to call back. I dialed her number and an unfamiliar male voice picked up the phone, I apologized and hang up assuming I had dialed a wrong number, I tried again and got the same voice, I tried to contain my composure and asked him if I could speak to my girlfriend, his answer ripped my heart in a million little pieces! He calmly told me ""his"" fiance was on holiday and he did not appreciate me calling her all the time. I am safely back home now. I just have to rest my head and my heart! It has been a long and stressful day and there is nothing I can do to forget about it. I just hope that tomorrow when I wake I will be level headed and start my healing and moving on journey. I do not know whether I will have the strength or the courage to fight for this love. Only time will tell, I highly doubt it though. Matters of the heart are very complex, no matter what age one is. All in all, life has to go on and I have to keep my head high, I will try however hard it is. Maybe next time I will love with my head and not my head, there could have been red flags but I was too blind to see.] =",recalled, imag,imagined

            [My story is about a family reunion in June of this year. My dad turned 90 on July 4th and he is the last  person alive on his side of the family. My grandparents came here when they were nineteen from Europe around 1911. They had three boys and one girl . I  have one whole sister and one half sister.  My dad and mom got divorced when I was sixteen. He remarried a girl much younger that was my babysitter and they had one girl. After he married her , she stopped inviting me and my sister over   and my dad would call occasionally and say come over, but when you weren't invited over for the past few years, you don't feel that invite is sincere and I didn't go. So I am not close with my half sister and we barely speak when we see each other out. My cousins parents from my dad's siblings never got divorced. So my cousins wanted to come in for my dad's 90th and they brought all kinds of food and pictures and we had a good time . Lots of pictures were taken and everything was great. I just felt that my life and relationship with my dad was very different than my cousins and they don't understand what it is like when parents get divorced and how kids can be treated because of it. I feel cheated in that respect and felt envious that they had normal childhoods and good relationships with their parents. I still talk to my dad when I see him in the local grocery store but it is just casual talk and that is kind of sad.  He is not going to be around much longer and I wish things had been different between us but I don't think it was all my fault . I think that will probably be our last family reunion . I am glad I got to see everyone and we had a great time. But it is also sad that it probably won't happen again . Not much you can do but accept things as they are and not dwell on them.] =",recalled, re,recalled

            [Back in March of 2019 my cousin celebrated her birthday by having a family cruise, which was set to go to a few different islands. I had never been on a cruise before so from the time I got to the port I was in complete amazement. Once we were on the ship and did the safety class my family and I went to explore all that we could do on the ship. A lot of my family hadn't been on cruises before either so it was a new experience for most of us. We partied for days, literally, but it was so much fun. We did everything from gambling at the casino to dancing in the clubs when night time came around. Not to mention I think we all ate more food than we ever ate before. When all food is included (except for alcohol) it's hard not to stuff your face with any and everything that's being cooked on the ship. Another cool thing that a lot of us enjoyed was playing basketball on the upper deck by the swimming pool. I had no idea that I would actually be able to play a game of basketball and it would feel like I was back home on the playground. There was absolutely no movement at all on the court so there was no difference than playing on solid ground instead of a ship in the water. By the time it was time to go back home everyone in my family was disappointing because we were having so much fun. We got back to the port, went through customs, and proceeded to get into our cars. Everyone looked at each other in disappointment but agreed that we'd definitely do it all again. I had a lot of fun with my family and was grateful that my cousin decided to celebrate her birthday by going on a cruise.] =",recalled, re,recalled

It's an entire 2600 miles away and I've, quite literally, never moved out of the state of Florida even though I've travelled plenty. Even though I'm thirty three years old, it doesn't stop my parents from worrying and missing me every day. It just so happens that this year my Mother was turning fifty back in June. I made the arrangements to fly home and throw her a surprise party with my sister-in-law. It was a whirlwind trip but it was definitely worth it! My Mom isn't much for being the center of attention or professing her emotions beyond what is necessary. In fact, it is quite possible I've seen my Dad cry more than I have seen her cry. That is saying a lot! At her birthday party, she was clearly very surprised when she arrived. There were easily a hundred people in attendance. The greatest moment of all, though, was when her eyes finally landed on me. She started CRYING and then she started laughing and then she cried some more. Her legs just about gave out from underneath her. To make things even better, it was all caught on tape! I will never, for the rest of my life, forget that moment. It is one of my very favorite memories.] =",recalled, imag,imagined

Having parents that were divorced and growing up in that environment, is the last thing I wanted for the kids. I don't think that my wife realizes how this is going to impact the kids. I am so sad, frustrated and upset by all,of this. All I wanted was to restore our family. I miss my wife. I miss being with the kids everyday. I miss us being a family. I continue to pray for healing and restoration, but I'm losing hope. I know God is in control, but I am struggling.

            [I found out I was going to be a father for the first time in my life earlier this year. My wife is due is the next 8 weeks and I am excited, anxious and everything in between. My wife and I were actually going to work on starting a family next year, however, it seems as though the universe had other plans. I was not sure at first how to feel about it but when I heard the baby's heartbeat for the first time, we were emotionally overwhelmed with joy. Hearing the heartbeat and seeing that little flicker of light on the screen was like staring at a star in space. It was a whole new experience for me as a person and seemed to remind me of the divine forces that work in our life sometimes. This new experience in my life also triggered so many other emotions, particularly the relationship with my family. My relationship with my family has been a roller coaster throughout my life and one of the most negative aspects in my life. The addition of a new baby seems to have bright some much needed positivity within my family but there is still some hesitation on my part to embrace my family. However, I do want my child to know their family and recognize how important that is. I have to remind myself that I need not project the failures of my parents on to my child and understand that those failures do not determine the quality of parent I am looking to be. My approach and mentality will be different. The situation my child will be born in to is already better than the one I was born in to. The changing of my priorities is scary but this is now my path. My baby's life is now at the forefront of my thinking and I must do everything in my power to ensure the life of this child can excel and prosper. This is my new normal and I look forward to learning many new things about myself and the world.] =",recalled, imag,imagined

It was very memorable because I have worked on it for so long that the acceptance for publication after rounds of rejections and resubmission was very emotion-inducing. We started out with a very high impact journal and went our way down. We added new data throughout the years. In addition, we also slightly changed the direction of the manuscript. We resubmitted the paper to a second high impact journal. Unfortunately, it was rejected as well. Eventually, everyone agreed that the manuscript has been improved a lot since the beginning. It was then accepted by a decent journal. Everyone who worked on the paper together went out for a celebration. We went to get Indian food. We had a great time! All our hard work paid off.

            [In May my mother died. I was an only child and my father passed when I was very young. She was the last close family I had left. It was so unexpected because nobody in her family had heart problems. I couldn't believe she died of a heart attack. She was old for a mother when she had me. Older than 40. But she lived a long life. This unexpected death totally threw my life into chaos. I had to take leave from work to make the funeral arrangements, settle all of her financials and clean and prepare the house for sale. I had to do this all the while feeling so sad and lonely. I am divorced and childless and I feel like I have nobody close to me anymore. To fill the void I have tried to renew my faith in God. I have started to go back to church.

We ordered so much food, and the biggest cake ever. We all had such a great time. I realized then, that she was growing up, and that her friends weren't really ""kids"" anymore either. It wasn't soon after the grad party that she was already getting her things in order to start college.

Somewhere along the line someone says something that rubs one of us the wrong way. Last night, it was probably him. Or maybe it was me. I don't even know what triggered the fight, and it was our first physical fight in a very long time. Stress seems to get things going even more. It's just hard, because I feel like I have no one to talk to but a damn notebook. These pages are my only peace. All day every day, I'm cooking and cleaning and chasing Jane around the house. Don't get me wrong, I love my Jane. She was my fate, and something I wanted for so long. But it's hard having a toddler again, and it's hard having teenagers when Sam is never home. When he is home he drinks or sits on the couch all day watching Netflix or other dumb movies. He doesn't try to interact unless he's drinking, and when he's drinking there's only a brief moment in time where he's fun and not angry or annoying or ... everything else. Don't get me wrong, I love him. But the fight last night makes me feel as if staying with him for all these years was bad on my kids. Is it going to be bad on Jane too? Did we fuck up our children by making things work despite all the fights they've seen and the mean words we've said to each other. Last night made me feel as if I should leave...but I can't.

When she broke free doing so meant losing her children, and four of the five that she lost have come back into our lives after she had missed them for 17 years.

I am so happy for her and yet fell so badly for the pain she is still in.  It is admittedly strange watching the kids blend together, as she had one child with a subsequent partner and then later two with me.

It is shocking to others that we are already grandparents, though our son doesn't have contact with his daughter.  I wish that I could help them more, with their challenges in life.

This was very difficult for me because we had been pretty serious about eachother (we had plans for a life together) and I wasn't expecting it at all.

My daughter, whose in her teens, had a very close relationship with her. I tried for months, to get her to work things out, but nothing that I tried or did, worked. I felt hopeless, utterly broken. I later found out, that the last year of our relationship she was seeing someone, and it further drove me into a downward spiral. But as they say, time heals all things. A few months ago, my ex reached out to me out of the blue. We had spoken before, briefly, but nothing of substance. Her texts through me for a loop, and for a moment, I felt like my prayers had been answered. She told me how she had missed me, my family, and thought about us a lot. After an exchange of texts for a few days, we met up, and it was the first time since our divorce, that I had seen her and it was like I was seeing her for the first time all over again. I told her how I felt about things, after finding everything out, how much it hurt, but also, that I still cared for her and there is nothing that could hold me back from wanting to give us another try. I thought things were looking up, I felt great. We went out on a few dates and things felt good. However, she was moving about an hour away, taking a new job and buying a house. I told her again, how I felt about her and she told me she wasn't in the same place. Ultimately, this hurt me quite a bit, and I felt like I was right back to where I was. Why did she text me to begin with? Did she want to know that I'd still be here? Things stopped after that, and we exchanged texts only occasionally, until she moved. I told her good luck with everything and to let me know if she ever needed anything. In those moments, I felt like we could be working towards something great, only to be left yet again, by the same person. Its been four months now and although I think about her from time to time, I believe things worked out for the best.] =",recalled, re,recalled

We worked together when our children were growing up. We didn't see each other as much as when we worked together. We talked on the phone a lot. I miss those phone calls.

            [I got fired from my job for stealing. I worked at a meat department in a big warehouse type store, and I had stolen a LOT of meat. I would hide steaks under cheaper cuts of meat and buy them. I would underweigh things and print off their labels and steal things that way. I got caught for something relatively minor, and management didn't know the extent of my theft. This happened about 4 months ago, and I've matured since then. I felt like a fucking idiot for getting caught. I was deeply ashamed and embarrassed. I was extremely grateful that the police didn't get involved. I feel that I get lucky like that a lot in my life, and I don't deserve it.   My boyfriend was very disappointed in my for the theft. He told me a lot to stop doing it, but I guess I'm the kind of idiot that has to learn from their mistakes. While I was stealing from work I had also started shoplifting from stores. I never got caught for the shoplifting, but I haven't shoplifted since. I feel like I made my stupid, dumbass mistakes, and I'm eternally grateful that I didn't suffer any real consequences from them. I want to be a better person now.] =",recalled, imag,imagined

It was old, nasty brown and green shag. Horrible. Right after closing I went over to the house with my sisters and parents. I was feeling discouraged about all of the work left to do. I wanted to get started right away. My sister and I started ripping up a bit of the carpet. To my astonishment we found that under the living room carpet was unbelievably gorgeous hardwood flooring. It'd been perfectly preserved for over 40 years. The same was in the dining room, bedroom, and hallways. The discovery will save me thousands of dollars on renovation costs and free us up to tackle other projects. It's much nicer than what I could afford.

Given my age, how long we were together, and how much I enjoyed her, I was thinking about proposing. I've never met anyone else in my life that I wanted to spend the rest of my life with. However, she decided to end our relationship. We were living together for the past 6 months. She came home from work like every other ordinary day and told me she wanted to talk to me. She told me she didn't see a future with me anymore. I was completely blindsided. I initially felt shock then panicked and tried to talk her out of it. I was quite emotional and she remained calm. She left and told me she would come back on the weekend to gather all her things. Not a day has gone by since that I haven't thought about it. It was emotionally devastating when it happened.

Getting my passport, and buying the plane ticket seemed small in the entire thing. What was really the big deal was getting on an airplane for the very first time. Being afraid of flying made this hard enough, but the excitement of going to another country on the other side of the world to meet the woman I loved overcame all of it. Her and I made plans to meet up at the airport when I arrived, and what we where going to do. When I got there, departed the plane, went through immigration,  and got my belongings she was no where to be seen. I waited for several hours outside the airport, trying to call her phone. When she finally answered, she told me she could not come to the airport. She asked me to just get a hotel and she would see me the next day. I was left in a foreign country alone I had no idea about, holding flowers and chocolates I brought for her. Looking foolish, I then decided to just get a taxi to a nice hotel for the night to relax from the jet lag, and decide what to do from there.  The next morning, she called me. She said she could not meet me that day either, maybe the next day she could. Her family called me, randomly, and said out of respect for me going all the way there they felt it was the right thing to do to tell me my girlfriend of 5 years had another boyfriend, and was pregnant.

            [My youngest child's birthday party was somewhat hard to plan. My husband was working second shift again at that time and so her party had to be on a weekend so that he should have the day off, but even that was not a promise. The weather was still cold enough at times that we knew it had to be an indoor party or we might get rained out. We ended up renting a building at one of the parks close by and decided to hold the party there. My dad and brother brought a heater over hours ahead of time so that we could warm up the building, even though the rules said we were not allowed to have a heater there, it was just too cold, so we watched it closely. My husband cooked BBQ pulled pork and shredded chicken for the guest and my mother made an amazing cake and cupcakes. The cake was a decorate rice-crispy treat and the cupcakes were chocolate, all were made to look like Minny Mouse. We noticed that we forgot a cooler for the pops but it was so cold out and there was snow on the ground still so we just set the cases of pop outside the door to the building. No reason to run back into town when nature was providing its own cooler for us.  My sister and one of her friends also showed up early to help decorate. A decent amount of people showed up but we all had a good time. My mom got her sugar glider out to show people and it ended up jumping on everyone's heads. It even jumped on my oldest and she freaked out and ran into a table. After making sure she was alright we found it kind of funny since sugar gliders are not dangerous animals at all. My youngest spent most of her time crawling around the building and being passed from one person to another but right after presents were opened and people were getting ready to leave she decided to surprise everyone and took a couple of steps. It wasn't much, but it was a start. I was also impressed that my mother-in-law showed up for the party because we had invited other family members that she dose not get along with as well and she usually tires to avoid them.

I worked on my resume and case for weeks on end to ensure i had the best chance of getting the position. i got into a few spats with coworkers about who should be promoted as well. this caused a lot of tension among us and made actual work tough for nearly a month. we had a first wave of interviews that knocked out half of the applicants. this made things even worse as some longer tenured employees were not pushed through to the second round of interviews. i was lucky enough to be pushed through myself. after the second round, we had two days where we did not know who had won the position. this was also stressful for us and put more tension on the office and all of us personally, as it was a life changing event for anyone who won the spot due to the salary and our life trajectories. after a few days, my manager called me into his office and informed me that i had won the position. this was a surprise to me as i thought other members were favored over me and would get the position. i was ecstatic to win the spot, as my salary more than doubled and i got great benefits. despite the stresses i was very happy with the situation.] =",recalled, re,recalled

            [Recently I left a homeless shelter for vets I had been staying at over the last two years. I'm a disabled OIF/New Dawn army vets with major depression, anxiety disorder, PTSD, and minor agoraphobia, and my time has run out at the shelter, meaning the VA wouldn't pay for more than 2 years of staying there. I had been living in LA for the last 7 years, since I left fort hood Texas. I moved to LA to try and go to UCLA, but I didn't realize at the time just how bad my mental condition was, and it quickly became apparent. After about 4 years of on and off trying to go to classes, and my symptoms becoming more apparent and dictating my life's choices. For 3 weeks I stayed in a park, hiding as best I could, and coming to near starvation. I found out from another homeless vet that although there weren't any shelters or food cupboards I could go to without a referral near by to where I was, I could always travel the 25 miles to go to the VA where they would place me in housing of some kind. So I finally did, and they put me in a recovery program for the homeless, mentally ill, and drug addicted vets of LA.  It turned out I was much worse outside and it was apparent to others how much worse I was doing mentally, than I was aware of on the inside - and the VA very quickly approved not only the increase to my disability benefits, going from 50% service connected to 100%, and also paying for my shelter stay on a 3 month basis, with a second manager from the VA coming to check on progress and whether I needed the continued shelter. Of course, this was great news, but I was still new to medication and therapy, and I was in an extremely self destructive and self hating place. I wanted to kill myself, I thought about it daily, I didn't think there was any hope, so when the good news came in, it barely registered in my mind. Just like my physical shape âÃÃ¬ going from 220 pounds at 15% body fat to 400 pounds in under 3 years âÃÃ¬ I was nearly unaware of my circumstances changing. And the VA paid me 15000 dollars in back pay from when I submitted the increase in benefits. Looking back, I wish I has been ready to leave then. But I wasn't. And over that year, I ate nearly 30000 in fast food, almost never leaving my room, and eventually breaking my leg with how overweight I got. In May of this year my time ran out. I had been on medication for nearly 6 months, and it had started helping a ton. No more panic attacks when I didn't go outside. Very little suicidal thoughts on a day to day. And my new case manager had helped me come up with great coping mechanisms for when I left. And so I did. I left for Florida, where my son is, and I've been living here since. I've dropped 40 pounds, I go on walks daily, I'm eating less than 1500 calories a day, and swimming multiple times a week, and now even working online with amazon mturk. I have my own apartment, I shop by myself, I cook on my own, don't eat any fast food, and soon, I hope to be in my sons life.] =",recalled, imag,imagined

I did not spend much time with them, so my grandmother too care of me a lot. The funeral was large because she had quite a few children and all of them attended. My grandmother had a lot of friends too so it was nice seeing all of them paying their respect. I did not talk much during the funeral. All I could do was think about all the good memories we had together. It was nostalgic. Seeing her body in the casket felt unreal. I could not believe that I could no longer spend time with her anymore. It made me regret not seeing her much when I was an adult.

Only, they started driving really recklessly. They were going too fast, cursing under their breath. I felt really afraid. I'd never seen them react like that. They insisted they were fine, their behavior behind the wheel said otherwise, however. Once we reached my house, I said quietly, ""I don't think this is working.""

I changed a lot of things because of that, and once I got out of the psych ward in hospital I've put a request for change of shift. Since then I started working out, changed my diet and got back to school. It was difficult and mind numbing. And now, a couple weeks ago, my boss called me to a meeting. There he told me that I'm getting a shift that I wanted, but on top of that I will get a promotion. It is small, nothing significant, to be honest.

So in a matter of two days, it was determined that we would make the 18 hour car ride to visit his home town and family. Thankfully, we had all gotten our passports the year before, so that headache was out of the way. I had to book the dog into an area kennel, but first had to get her vaccines up to date.

We made it to the border in good time, and actually got our permits and crossed the border all in about a half hour. This was the most surprising even of the whole trip there, because I remember multiple times when we have been stuck for almost five hours by border patrol, so this was a blessing. Once we got further into central Mexico, the scenery was really gorgeous. The air had cooled down, and the mountains were beautiful. We got to his town around 10pm and were welcomed by the cross that shines on the mountain, or La Bufa, in his city. It was really pretty and I was glad that we decided to make the trip. The children were exhausted, and cranky from being in the truck for almost an entire day. We stopped at a street vendor when we were coming into the city, and got tacos. Let me tell you, they try to do street tacos in Texas, but nothing is better than the real thing.

The lady that runs it was a friend and co-worker of mine, so when I decided to start volunteering I reached out to her and she said this was something she thought I'd like. I really wasn't sure what to expect when I got there. I had worked in a community garden before and it seemed like most of the poor people who showed up just wanted the vegetables and didn't want to really put in the work needed to maintain the garden. When I showed up I was kind of skeptical about how it would go but I was ready. The event was way more than I expected. We had over 100 people show up. They didn't seem like they were just there for a handout, they wanted to learn how to maintain and grow the gardens we were giving them. They asked about watering and sunlight and took a lot of time picking the plants they wanted to grow. The best part about it was the kids that came. Sometimes they were more excited than the parents about starting the garden. It was encouraging to see. Wendy, the lady that runs the program said changing the mindset of the next generation of low income is important and I felt like we were doing that. Teaching them about the importance of vegetables and how you can grow your own might actually help them be better and healthier adults.

My friends were all tired, and I was as well. Mostly because I was super anxious and ready to get married finally. But it all went smoothly, and we were done in about 3 hours. We still had time to kill, so we went to grab lunch nearby. Then shortly after that we got ready to head to the church to finish getting ready for the wedding. Now that part was chaotic. My dad lost or misplaced parts of his suit rental. And, my dress which had fit previously the week before, was not closing up properly. Go figure, I ended up having to be sewed into my dress. Then it came time to get married finally. And all of the stress and anxiety went away the moment I saw my husband finally. It went very smoothly, even though our friend dropped our wedding rings. We said our vows and all that. And then after the ceremony was over we headed to the after party. There are alot of cherished memories that come along with that day. And, I'll never forget it.] =",recalled, re,recalled

            [A few months back my son wanted to go Off-roading in his fairly new Jeep. We decide to make a day of it and take a few others with us. We head out to a town near us that had this deserted road that people are known to trek on. It was a beautiful day for this, sunny, clouds 80-degree weather, what more could we ask for. About halfway through this road, we encounter a fairly steep embankment that crossed some water. We had to cross it to continue, so one of our passengers get out and try to guide us down this hill. on the road down there were trenches on either side from the tires digging in the mud from the previous rain. We start to head down trying to avoid the left side tire trench as it was the deeper of the two, this proved to be a difficult task as we quickly fell in the hole. Our only option was to ""GUN IT!"" as the person who was guiding us exclaimed. So we did just that, as we did we teetered to the left, we were so deep that our two right-side tires had completely lifted off the ground. We slowly fell to the ground and hit hard if it wasn't for the Jeep's Roll Cage it could've ended up far worse, but we were all fine. But stuck out in Timbuktu. So we had to call a tow truck to get the Jeep out of the ditch, we were they for what felt like hours in direct sunlight before they arrived and got the Jeep back up without a problem. While the bill of paying the tow truck wasn't fun, the day I had spent with my family sure was. Considering that spending quality time with family now is far few and in between, I cherish the memories I do have.] =",recalled, re,recalled

            [It was the end of the semester in a very difficult class. I had not done my final project for the class and there were only a few days left to complete it.  This was extremely stressful and bothered me greatly. The class was online and I had no reason to try hard throughout the first part of the class, nor did I have anyone looking over my shoulder to encourage me to try harder.  I found myself in a severe time crunch.      The class was a video creation course and we were tasked with creating a video through shorts created from our own cameras.  The video would have to show off our technical capabilities with Premier Pro, which is Microsoft video editing software.       I had only 2 days to create and edit a film.  It was a daunting task.   I went though several thoughts including dropping out, and giving up.  I decided that it was my fault I was in the time crunch, and I had to get started and turn in something at the very least.  The film had to be made. Of course the film also had to make sense as well and have a story. I had created nothing over the last few months, nor did I have any clue of what to do to start with. After brainstorming I had a idea! I quickly found some old footage of me driving a truck from a dash cam, then created a story based on places I had seen or been, I added some background music, and a voice over, and amazingly succeeded in creating a solid project for my class.   I ended up with a great grade but I attribute that to my abilities to perform under pressure and creativity ,not my sense of time management.] =",recalled, re,recalled

            [Taking a walk through the Detroit Institute of Arts was an experience that I wasn't expecting to experience anytime soon. It was a great way to end the semester after all the new concepts I have learned from the online ARTH 100 course. Walking through the DIA and seeing concepts that each artist included into their own works of art was truly beautiful, and I wasn't able to see this type of beauty portrayed in their work until after I had taken this course online. Furthermore, one of my many favorites had to be Fowl and Melons, an oil canvas painting, painted by Sisson Blanchard  who is from Haiti, born in 1952. This oil painting was truly beautiful and caught my eye due to the colors and uniqueness of the birds. Looking deeper into the painting were details that didn't originally catch my eye, and that I had to look for. That being said, there were watermelons actually painted in between the birds in this painting! That being said, colors had a big influence on how my eye caught these details. The colors red, orange, yellow, deep blue and purple] =",recalled, re,recalled

            [So the story I want to tell you about would be my adventure about trying to get my son into school. Into a good school that is. When I went to get game into the school I found out that we were 10 feet from the district line for the school. I wanted home to be in this zone and this was super upsetting obviously. He was going to have to go to a school district that was not safe at all and one that me and my wife did not want him to have to go to. We really needed him to get into the school in to the right one.  So we decided that the only course of action would be for us to move. That of course is a lot easier said than done. We needed to move so we would not have to pay tuition so we started looking for a new place to live. This led us to realize that the housing market is crap her so we went weeks and weeks to try to find a decent place to live no  luck. this was unfortunate. this is not what we needed or even wanted this was a really large let down on all fronts. I called the school board and they said the rules were that he would have to pay tuition I tried to apply for a waiver since we were so close to the right zone but no luck. So, in the end, we paid the tuition. We still have not found a place to rent. This is one of the most frustrating experiences off my life.] =",recalled, re,recalled

            [I traveled to Indonesia last month for thirty days. I've been to this amazing country twice before but only to Bali, which I love but is only a tiny section of Indonesia and this time I wanted to experience something. Yogyakarta was my state of choice and as soon as I landed I just knew I was in for a treat. Yogyakarta was absolutely astonishing, the energy and vibe here always had me on cloud 9 and smiling from ear to ear. The local people of Indonesia are amazing, friendly and welcoming. Yogyakarta is known as the cultural heart of Indonesia and I can see why. Even though Indonesia is well developed, with all the western accommodations, it doesn't feel overly developed, your surrounded by nature and still sticks to Indonesia's cultural roots. The food, the art, the temples and just the number of natural amazement's, there is a limitless amount of things you can find to do. While here I learned a bit more about the history of this country and even learned a few more words in Indonesian. I stayed amongst the locals, as well as places near trendy Main streets, with great hipster cafes, gelato shops, and high-end restaurants, however, the local street food had me coming back time and time again. I also enjoyed the time I spent with, other fellow travelers, exchanging travels stories and just getting to know one another. I hiked and camped on top on volcano mountains and swam in the most beautiful blue and turquoise oceans. I rode a motorbike through the streets, down to the countrysides and into local villages, and was always greeted with smiles and waves. I did yoga and mediated, whilst overlooking sunsets and sunrises. I loved my time in Yogyakarta Indonesia and will be visiting this beautiful country again.] =",recalled, imag,imagined

            [Never in my wildest dreams did I ever think that something so mind-blowing, heartwrenching, and beautiful could ever happen to me. I mean, I was present when my sister gave birth to my first nephew and I got to witness him come into this world... but never in my wildest dreams did I ever think I would have to deliver one of her children. When Miley Cyrus sang ""I came in like a wrecking ball"", I don't quite think she really knew what that meant, considering this sweet baby that I had delivered, had done in a physical sense. I woke up that morning and my sister and I were about to go shopping for some of her baby shower decorations when she tells me that she does not feel very well. We weren't expecting for the baby to come for another four weeks, so neither one of us detected that she was actually having contractions, especially considering they didn't really feel like contractions to her. She decides to lie down for a little while to see if maybe a little rest would help her feel better. Well, a few hours later she thought she needed to use the restroom so she got up, and she felt something really strange. By this time she calls me into her room and as I'm walking in she starts screaming that the baby's head is crowning already so I call 911 to get an ambulance on it's way, but the baby was coming way too quickly. I rush to gather some towels at this point because I just already knew that this baby was coming fast. I get my sister laid back on her bed and have her hold her legs up. At this point more of the baby's head is showing. The 911 operator is calmly telling me what to I need to do, but I'm still freaking out a good amount so I put the phone on speaker so that I can do exactly as they tell me to do. I counted with my sister and helped her with her breathing and pushes, and after three long pushes, out comes this baby. At first he's really quiet so I really start to freak out, but as I wrap him in the towel and rub his back, he let's out this strong wail. I pass him over to my sister and just about the time the 911 operator is telling me what else I need to do after this point, the paramedics knock on the door.] =",recalled, imag,imagined

            [I had a memorable event that has stuck with me when I was given the opportunity to buy my dream car. I have always driven a full size pick-up truck and due to my commute to work decided that it was time to downsize and buy a more compact car. I have long wanted a 4 door Audi A3. The style and overall design really attracted me the the Audi line. With a strong financial income and little to no debt I thought that it was time for me to make my dream purchase. I went to my local Audi dealership two weeks before vacation with high hopes of driving away in my dream car. Two dealerships later and a whole lot of negotiating I was given the deal that worked for me and was able to drive away in my brand new Audi A3. 	It was a cold April night when I finally completed signing my life away and was handed over the keys to my new car. I will never forget the smell of that black and grey leather interior. Also, the feeling of the heated leather seats! Due to the weather that night and how late it was I decided to head home and wait until the next day to go for a nice long ride. I left my house the following day after admiring the exterior of the car and how good it looked parked in front of my house and headed straight for the beach. I know, surprising right? Heading to the beach on a cold April day? Yes! To this day I enjoy my rides to work just a little bit more each day thanks to my beautiful Audi A3. The added bonus is the gas mileage that I get with this car! I would highly recommend this compact sporty vehicle to anyone in the market. Thank you Audi] =",recalled, imag,imagined

I've always been a good worker, I've had many personal issues with my family that sort of made it difficult to work consistently. When I finally got into the finance department, I felt very proud of myself and I shed a few tears. For some reason it just felt like this weight was lifted from my shoulders. I've been working so hard as an intern, doing trivial work and trying to learn everything I can, I've also had many problems with my personal life. When I finally signed a contract, I just felt so emotional. My father has been ill for a while and he has always pushed me to work harder and not to help him so much.

I tend to be a bit of an amateur astronomer and like to stargaze. On the horizon that I was facing I saw a strange object. It was a spherical shape and of a purple hue. The object began to rise and change it's color to a deep green. It continued to alternate between colors. The sphere began to move toward me but did not make a sound. As it approached my direction, it continued to rise. When it was directly overhead, I would estimate it at about 500 feet. It was about the size of a small private plane. It then be began to increase speed rapidly and disappeared. The speed it was moving at was astonishing. The experience was unbelievable.

Being far away from our best friends is hard but one day after this whirlwind military lifestyle, we will be able to add roots.  We were suppose to go to their house this year because we alternate locations but instead they came to us since the hubby is on a crazy work schedule.   The day started out moggy and hot, that should have been our first sign that we were in for an adventure.  We pack all 8 kids, the coolers, the trailer with our camping gear and lots of sunscreen and bug spray.  The GPS says it will take 4 hours to drive to the river.  Boys are in one vehicle, girls are in the other.  We take our time on the drive because tonight will just be s'mores and a bonfire.  We finally make it to our campground around 3:00pm.  We unpack the vehicles and trailer so we can get the two tents up before dark.  After an hour, we have the tents up and have started setting up chairs, fire pit, coolers, food, and horseshoes.  Around 6pm, we start cooking hotdogs and just hang out for the night.  We know that we will have to be up by 9am to get ready for the river.  The kids are excited because they get to float by themselves for the 1st time.  Next morning, we make some eggs and bacon, zip the food into the tents, and clear the trash away.  We load onto the bus so it can take us to the river, we have a 6 mile float ahead of us.  Everyone gets their tube and life vest on, we tie up the little kids to an adult.  The river is much faster than the previous kayak tour we did at another place.  About an hour in, we started hitting the rafts, and it was hard to navigate the wood sticking out of the river.  In the 3rd hour, 4 of us got slammed into the wood and bashed our legs up.  Thirty minutes from that, pouring rain on the river.   Finally after an hour of waiting we got back in the river.  The last 3 hours were amazing, did not want it to stop.  We we finally reached the end point, we did not want to call it a night so we swam in the river, jumping off the cliffs and rope swing for the next two hours.  It was an amazing camping trip that I will never forget.] =",recalled, re,recalled

He told me that he and found out that he was ill and would not have long to live. He said that he had always felt like he could manage his life the way it was. He said that after he found out this news he felt that his life was worthless. He told me that he had not wanted to eat for days and that it was hard for him to eat anyway. Due to the fact that he had very little money and very little support it was hard for him to muster up the strength to fend for himself. I sat down next to him and spoke with him for a while about what he was going through and offered to buy him something to eat.

            [When we entered the cave on our tour, the air gradually cooled and there was a sensation of wind blowing across our skin. The waterfall near the entrance to the cave itself, as we walked down the stairs, tinkled musically.  A rich earthy smell, pleasant and verdant, filled the air around us.  We went through the entrance area and entered into the cave opening itself. The ceiling is low here and some people had to duck.  We followed the guide along a paved path that was very easy to walk along, past some interpretive signs about the animals that live near the cave's entrance.  There was a notation that no animals live within the cave itself.  The guide slowly walked us into a larger chamber of the cave and using a flashlight, directed everyone to a metal railing.  We were asked to firmly grab the rail and once he confirmed that everyone was holding the rail, he turned his light off, plunging us into complete darkness. Then the guide said, ""Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to The Mammoth Cave,"" and flipped on the brighter tour lights.  Suddenly, before our eyes we realized we were standing in an immense cavern that stretched out beyond where the light touched.  Many people gasped in delight and awe as they took in the scope and size of this wondrous place. My daughter turned to me with sparkling eyes and breathed, ""It's so beautiful! I had no idea a cave could be this big!""  I too, was stunned at the size, having been in many caves and thinking of them as low, tight places.  Our whole group listened to the guide as he told of the cave's discovery, how people mined for saltpeter here during the American Civil War, how a doctor thought the cave air could cure tuberculosis patients and brought them here in the hopes they would recover.  We saw the places where a preacher gave sermons and where visitors marked their names on the roof of the cave with candle soot. Visiting the Mammoth Cave was an experience that taught me so much.

            [One significant event that has happened to me in the last six months was staying in Europe for 3 months. We first arrived in the Czech Republic, Prague. We arrived in the evening and because it was winter, the sun went down sooner. I had never been to Europe before and we went out in the dark onto one of the busiest parts of the city and I remember it being unlike anything else I had ever seen before. They were roasting meat on sticks. There were foreign pastries every way you looked. The sidewalks were made out of bricks that were laid hundreds of years ago. People were sitting on the steps of castles casually eating their sour kraut. We walked out into the square and I remember looking up at the old buildings and beautiful architecture. I had never seen buildings that old in America. It started snowing in that moment and I remember it being one of the most beautiful memories I have ever had. It was something out of a dream. My kids and I held hands and walked together. I am glad I got to experience something like that. I am interested in writing about this story in further detail at a later time.] =",recalled, re,recalled

During that time, I've applied and interviewed to more than few dozens companies. Finally, this week I received a great news, a job offer as a web producer close to where I live. This is a really an exciting news, upon receiving the news I get to celebrate with my family and went to our favorite restaurant. While, the job responsibility is simple and straight forward, I know it will be quite challenging. Knowing that I haven't been working in an office setting for more than 5 years is very nerve wrecking. I've been away from the work force to  focus on my family and raising my children. So, the thought of taking care of the family, attending to the children, and the demand of the job maybe too overwhelming at the moment. On top of that I have to learn new software and technology in less than a month. I'm confident with my experience and skill set I can adjust quickly. But imagining how crazy my daily schedule can be, seems quite challenging. Nevertheless I am very grateful this job offers opportunity to work from home, a really good starting salary, and close from home. So, I don't have to commute and deal with traffic on daily basis. Moreover, I can still focus on my family as well earning additional income. Finally, I no longer unemployed and once again become a positive contributor to the society.] =",recalled, imag,imagined

The plan was to be there for three months. I packed my bags the day before I was set to leave. I did not have a car and the airport was a few hours away. My flight was at 3 pm.   I left my dad's house at 5 am and took the city bus to the airport. I would arrive at 9 am and check in for my flight. I didn't have much money and had bought some snacks to tide me over. A few hours before my flight I went through security. I had never been so nervous. I was traveling with just two bags a laptop.  I had some PC gaming equipment and was unsure I would be able to get it through security.   I made it through with no problems and boarded my plane.

            [A while ago my new neighbor moved in. For a bit of background, I live in a basement apartment in a house. Half of the time, the upstairs is an AirBNB, the other half it is rented by other tenants. The upstairs has two bedrooms, while down here is just one. Anyway, the previous neighbors were a couple, they were pretty nice, they have a dog. My new neighbor is a younger guy, who also has a dog. When he moved in my landlords let me know he was moving in. I decided to bake him some cookies, so I biked down to the grocery store to get chocolate chips. He started moving in, and I made the cookies. I overheard my landlord mentioning that she was thinking about baking cookies but did not because it was too hot out, so I was relieved that I wouldn't be doing something redundant. I finished the cookies and was nervous about bringing them up. Was the timing good, would he be busy? I am nervous about talking to people. Eventually I put them on a plate, covered the plate with plastic wrap, and brought them up before they lost too much heat. My neighbor was out there, near his car, I talked to him and handed him the cookies which he accepted. His mother was helping him move in, I shook her hand and talked to her also. Once the conversation seemed like it was winding down I said I'd let him get back to moving in and went back inside. Also I gave him a card with my phone number.] =",recalled, re,recalled

            [The most memorable event for me in the last few months was going to a cheese festival. My fiance's mom wanted to come visit us that weekend but we had already had plans to go to this festival. She decided that she would come with us as well. It was so hot outside, in the upper 80s. The event was outdoors, on the streets, with no respite from the sun. This made it challenging for vendors to keep their cheeses cold and stocked. The event drew a bigger crowd than they had imagined. Many vendors started selling out of their most popular items within the first few hours.  We found a small cafe that had a table available after being told that it would be over an hour wait at the location we originally planned to eat at. We quickly realized why the cafe was so empty. The food was like something they would serve at Fyre Festival. The Caesar salad was just a few pieces of lettuce and dressing. We could complain, but we were just so relieved to be inside and out of the heat. Later, we found humor in the conditions of the food we ordered. This is a found memory for me because I do not often get to spend time with my future mother in law, so it was nice to have time to bond.] =",recalled, re,recalled

            [Today we celebrated my 47th birthday. My wife, our three kids, and my dad had all decided that they were going to treat me to a day of fun stuff tailored specifically to me. I'm not normally the type to indulge myself as I'm usually so busy taking care of others but I decided to just lean into everything and enjoy myself. We drove to downtown Los Angeles for a wonderful Italian lunch at Bestia. During lunch, I was struck by the free flowing nature of the conversation, the spontaneous bursts of irreverence and quirkiness that are emblematic of a close family. I was profoundly moved by the precocious nature of our kids interacting with my dad because it made me feel like a bridge between two generations of family. I could see very clearly how the best aspects of what my dad had taught me about being a parent were being passed down to his grandkids, who in turn were on their way to becoming well rounded adults. This illustrated itself vividly as we moved on to the after lunch event, a screening of Laurel and Hardy's classic comedy ""Sons of the Desert"", one of my all time favorites, and a movie that my Dad had shared with me when I was a child. I'd seen the move dozens of times I was enthralled by the hilarious comedy of errors unfolding onscreen but our kids were utterly and completely involved in that special way when one encounters timeless art. As they rolled in the aisles, doubling over from hysterical laughter, I felt a singular sense of joy and accomplishment. My dad had given me something precious, and after cultivating it for years I was handing it off to my kids for their own pleasure. It was then that I realized that beyond material gifts, what really matters on birthdays is reflecting on where you're going, who is going on the journey with you, and what we're all learning on the way there. As a kid, my dad always treated me as an intellectual equal because he figured that what I didn't understand would only pique my curiosity to learn more. In turn, I tend to do the same with my kids and the effect is the same. Their quest becomes something that we all get involved in and by doing so we all end up learning something about each other. This engenders closeness, and what I realized that day is just how close I feel to the people with whom I'm sharing this wonderful life with. To me that's the essence of family.] =",recalled, re,recalled

As the days keep going by I am now starting to think I may have over-estimated my abilities. I need more coaching that I thought I would and even after 4 months I still feel like a new employee. I like my work enviroment and everyone seems to be nice and helpful but I still feel like I don't quite fit in yet. Last week as I was talking to one of my co-workers she mentioned she got a raise.

If I don't recieve a raise I will be embarresed as to ask for extra help to learn things. I guess at this point the best I can do is wait and don't get over my feeling about this.

I had expected that my car was going to be repossessed because  husband had been ordered to make that car payment.  He failed to do so.  I felt horrible and I felt scared because I was unsure what I was going to do. He had been ordered by the court to make the payments.  We eventually had a contempt hearing where he was ordered to catch up all bills and he would be paying the payment on a new vehicle.  It worked out well for me though because the new car I received was a lower payment.  Eventually I will have to take that payment over and when I do I will be able to afford it.  Everyone thinks my ex is a loser including myself.  I was so furious with him for not caring enough to make sure his children had transportation.

I was super excited to see my sister and my son was super excited to see his cousin. It was a whole lot of fun and we did a lot of activities while we were there. We went hiking with and without the kids. We went and drank and danced when we were by ourselves, but we went on a trail walk when we took the kids. Me and my sister participated in adult activities such as going to the bar and going to the arcade, which also had a bar. We went to eat a numerous amount of times and just enjoyed each other's company. On our vacation we did a lot of dancing and just lounging around. The most surprising thing that happened to me is that i developed a stye on my eye the day before our last day on our trip. My son did not pay me any attention the whole trip because he was so excited to see his cousin. They played all day and night and hardly went to sleep in fear of missing out on the fun times. We went to the mall and did a little bit of shopping and window shopping just to pass the time. Me and my sister rode to Denver with some friends one of the nights I was there and got a big gigantic airbnb. We cooked, listened to music and just vibed with each other that whole night. On the last day of our trip we took the entire group including the kids to lunch. Afterwards we went back to my sister's house and played board games and watched movies until we fell asleep. When it was time to go back home we were sad yet happy to be going home. The flight back seemed very short, probably because me and my son slept almost the whole way there.] =",recalled, re,recalled

            [I have three huskies, who are incredible dogs, and one of them is a certified therapy dog. His name is Sheriff, and him and I have been going to Shriners Hospital for Children once a week for the past year. About 6 months ago when we were there I noticed a young girl about 7 years old. she would stand way in the back  of the auditorium away from the other children. She look so sad, and in turn it made me feel so sad. I've learned that you can't force someone to participate, only encourage. At times I felt disheartned as it seemed we were not making any progress. And I had to remind myself that this was a long term therapy program and she was battling a terminal illness. Over about 4 weeks I would slowly get closer to her with Sheriff. During this time I would make more and more eye contact with her and hold it for longer period of times. Eventually we were about 5 feet in front of her and I could sense her curiousity. So I asked if she would like to pet Sheriff. I still remember her smile and her hesitation as she walked up to her Sheriff. She sowly reached out and touched him then backed away quickly. The next week she came up to him on her own , and the following week she came up to him and hugged him. My heart felt like it would burst. I knew then without a doubt that she would remember this moment, as I would.  Over the course of the next few months we grew close and would talk, as she  relaxed with the help of Sheriff. About a month ago, the director of the program asked if Sheriff and I would come in one day to visit Rebecca in her room. Her illness had taken a turn for the worse and she had a matter of days, if that, to live. It was an extremely sad day and a difficult day. Her mom told me that Rebecca's wish was to spend time with Sheriff as he made her happy. I knew then the power a therapy dog has to heal and warm the heart. I also knew that I would never forget this day , this experience.] =",recalled, re,recalled

            [This week, my son started first grade. He is the youngest of all of my children and the only boy. He was in kindergarten last year, and that was hard for me as well, as I had to come to terms with the fact that he was growing up and wasn't my little baby anymore. However, it was only kindergarten so he still felt like a ""baby' to me. This year however, he is noticeably older and more grown up. As he walked down the street towards the bus on his first day of first grade, he looked like a ""big kid"" instead of my little baby. It made me both happy and sad. As he is becoming such a wonderful young man, yet at the same time my little baby no longer is little (This is also evident as his clothes from last year are too small. Last year they were too big). Most surprisingly, he wasn't scared or nervous this year. At the start of kindergarten last year, he cried and begged me to stay home. I really wanted to keep him home as well! This year, didn't cry for me or try to run back home for another hug. I was glad he was feeling more independent, but part of me wished he needed me more. My little man is growing up so fast. I wish I could turn back the time and keep him my baby forever. Although I cannot, he will still always be ""mamas baby"".] =",recalled, imag,imagined

I'm very excited to move in and get everything situated and start buying all the things that I need to make it our little home. It's in a gated community so it's safer then most apartments around the area, and they allow dogs as well. I'm really happy about being able to bring my pet along, and I know he's excited for the new home as well. I'm also hopeful that we can find a really good deal on some couches, so we can spend a bit more on the t.v. we want to buy for our house. I'm just really excited to be taking this step with my boyfriend, and I hope he feels the same way. There might be some struggles along the way, as we find out what it means to own our own place, but I'm sure that we'll manage as long as we are in this together. We've already got a few things gifted to us by his parents, they've given us the basic forks, plates and some things for the bedroom as well. We'll be taking his bed with us, so we won't have to worry about sleeping on the floor when we first move in. The most surprising thing about us getting our own little place was that his aunt had bought us an entire bathroom set. I hadn't been expecting it, due to her living in Chicago, but I thought that was really sweet and kind of her to do. We both thanked her, and made sure that we'd do our best to take care of the things that came in the set. I'm just overly excited about being able to finally have my own place, since I had originally been living with my parent still, so had my boyfriend.

I know there are going to be challenges along the way, but I personally believe that in the end, we're going to make it work and have a place to call home!] =",recalled, imag,imagined

            [Dearest online diary,Today was my first full day as a solo team lead, meaning the store was mine and only mine from open to close. Granted, it's the Sunday 11am-7pm shift, but it was mine and mine alone. It's great being acknowledge with a promotion and responsibility after years of neglect and downright disrespect. See, I was kicked out of a university professor job simply because the dean of the school did not like me in any way. He said that my student reviews were ""far below average"" even though they weren't, and he refused to provide the average. He said my ratings from the first semester did not get better at all, citing a single solitary number from an odd class that wasn't in my area of knowledge, and was more than a year old. I couldn't fight back because he is known for retaliation and my wife had the same job in the same school, and I don't want to screw her over. So, I had to get a retail job. I worked at a home improvement store and within four months, was sabotaged out of the department despite video evidence supporting me that magically supported them. I am 100% certain they kicked me out because I'm not a redneck like them and didn't fit in. So, I was put in a 5am-9am job six days a week for a year with no paid time off, no vacation, no benefits of any kind. Obviously, this was crap so I sought out a promotion by doing all the in-home training and in-store work that I could, but was denied it over and over. I was also lied to about a pay raise for joining the renovation team. So, I left for my current job. Within 8 months, I was promoted to a team lead with a $3.75/hr pay raise. For my two month training period, I worked with the managers to open and close the store and all the deskwork I need to do. Finally, today was my first day: I opened and closed (with setting/turning off the alarms), made the deposit and took it to the bank, counted all drawers, dealt with all customer issues, managed 3 other employees, and we didn't burn it down.] =",recalled, re,recalled

It's always a fun time when they're over and usually my mother and I like taking them to go grab some quick grub from wherever they're feeling like to that day. We loaded up the guys and went on our way. As we were leaving I felt a bump under the rear tire but thought nothing of it as we live on a dirt road and there's always big rocks shifting and whatnot. We got their food and ice cream and headed back home so they could eat comfortably. When arrived to the house I saw now what I thought was a mere rock was in fact my cat, Patches. I quickly drove around it's body and helped bring the kids in because I didn't know how they would react. I was still in shock at this moment as I couldn't accept what I had done. I still can't get the image of her lifeless body just laying there. I did this, no one else but me. I was not careful enough and just kept on driving without checking if there was anything around. Of course both kids couldn't stay inside without curiosity getting the better of them and came outside as I had picked her up and moved here until I found a suitable place to bury her. They questioned what had happened and I am not one to make up stories/fantasies and told them what happened. I had this cat since before either of my niece and nephew were born. While she was getting old, she was still always full of life. To my surprise they told me that everything was going to be okay and that accidents happen. To believe such little human beings could comfort an adult in a sad time is amazing, and I am so thankful to have them in my life.] =",recalled, imag,imagined

She went through a week of radiation. She did overall well. Soon after we found out that chemo was recommended to help greatly reduce the risk of recurrence. At first it was emotionally hard because I could only think about seeing my mom without hair and possibly weak. Now I realize that I will stand behind my mom and her decisions.

Three months ago she and I decided to take a break from it all and booked a room at a hotel in the White Mountains of New Hampshire. To warrant the costs we treated it as an early anniversary gift to ourselves, as we were coming up on 10 years of being married. As my family is in another state, and her parents are no longer with us, we also booked our favorite babysitter to watch the three kids. The kids were ecstatic to learn that the babysitter was going to be watching them for two nights. We left once Lauren came and made our way to the White Mountains. It was a nostalgic trip up as we hadn't been in that area since before we were married. A lot had changed in the 10 plus years, more shops and everything looked new and expensive. The one exception was the restaurant that we had visited more times than we could count when we were fresh out of college and in that area, the Moat! We had dinner that night in the restaurant and walked through all that had changed since we were last there. We reflected on the hardships, where our life had turned in unforeseen ways and how little we were eventually prepared for all that had happened since. As we continued on throughout the weekend I reflected on how comfortable I had become with being next to my wife. Reflecting on the feeling I can only think of our relationship as a well worn tool that has seen the passage of hundreds of hours of time. Worn down a little, but smooth and comfortable. It sounds almost like a bad thing when I read it here but I also know that I find myself more and more in love with my wife the deeper into life we go.] =",recalled, imag,imagined

            [About 5 months ago, I had a kidney transplant. It was very scary and exciting all at the same time. I knew I would have a transplant for a long time, as the kidney disease I had was the result of Lupus. When my kidney failure reached end-stage, I went into treatment that kept my kidney function at a certain level. It was a level that was low enough to allow you to be considered for a transplant, but not emergency-level yet. Doctors said if I could stay at that level of function, I could still live many years without needing a transplant or dialysis. After a couple of years, I started getting kidney stones and sometimes they needed surgery. They started to harm what was left of my kidney function, so I got my transplant.  The day of the transplant, I went with my husband. We had to be at the hospital very early and we left the house at 4 am. We aren't morning people and we were both nervous but there wasn't anything to really say. So we sat in relative silence for a while in the hospital room. It was about 3 hours util I went into the surgery theater. As they were wheeling me in, I couldn't believe it was actually going to happen after all the time I spent learning and worrying about it. I was very scared but I had to meet so many people and answer so many questions that it kept my mind occupied. I remember shaking with nerves while I talked to the anesthesiologist. That was the most scared I got, but it was the last thing before they started giving me medication. I don't really remember much after our conversation, until I woke up in recovery. I asked for my husband right away and I was so releived and happy. He was right there waiting so from then on he was by my side.  Once I got into my room, he stayed with me until it was late at night. After that first day I could only see him every afternoon because we lived two hours away from the hospital and he also had to keep working. I was so happy to go home after 10 days.] =",recalled, re,recalled

            [Today, I ended up talking with my ex again. We always end up talking, monthly. But today I realized that I wasn't always right. He had done so much wrong that it blinded me to everything. I wanted him to make up for everything bad he's done, without giving the opportunity for him, as a person, to be able to make it up to me how he could. It was an impossible task and impossible standards that I kept asking of him. I couldn't see past myself, I could only see me and how wounded I was. It might mean that the damage has been done, but this different perspective has given me a lot to think about now. How often have we cycled through the same thing over and over again with no change, because I'd been insisting he needs to be different without giving him a chance to be so. I ask him to jump and want no hesitation, but he's always been the type to hesitate. I just really didn't take into account who he was, and how we could compromise or come to a solution. At this point in time I'm still processing the information, the feelings, and what it all means. I feel more confused now than I have ever been. It's funny, because you don't ever want to see yourself in a bad light especially when truly, you were hurt the most. He DID do bad things, I'm not negating that, but I also have been expecting some changes that are probably impossible. I would get overwhelmed talking to me too, the way I have been. I can only hope to learn from it if not for this relationship, than any in the future.] =",recalled, re,recalled

            [On May 20th, 2019 my girlfriend , my friend, and myself drove to and around Joshua Tree National Park to film different wild animals like rattlesnakes, coyotes and owls. We had spent about five hours in the late afternoon looking before it got dark and we decided to head home. We were driving thru a town next to the park called 29 Palms that has a marine base in it when we saw a UFO from the car! It was a long bright light in the sky that was out in the desert. We pulled over and started to film the object and talk about what it was. It didn't seem to move much in the air and didn't seem far away. My Girlfriend was driving and figured we might be able to get closer to it (we were about a mile away) so we drove down some streets to get to it. We were able to drive right up too it and film it for about 25 minutes. The light looked like a long glowing ribbon in the sky that made no noise. It was very windy but was able to control itself against the wind and would lift up into the sky a few hundred feet and come back down less then one hundred feet about our heads. Many other people started to stop and see the UFO. After close to 30 minutes since we originally saw the object it started to move away from up and against the wind making us get back in our cars and drive another street over to it. As we pulled up we saw the item come down to the ground and turn off. Myself, my Friend and 9 other people that stopped to see the UFO all ran out of our cars and into the desert to look for it, but we couldn't find it at all. We couldn't figure out where it went or what it was. The most likely explanation was it was a light up tail of a kite or a rope on a drone but it made no noise so drone is out, if it's a kite where was the guy holding it? They had to have seen all these people stopped on the side of the road looking and running into the desert to find it. There are some powerlines that cross between where we stood under the object and where it came down so that's not safe and how did it not get stuck? I have tried looking for the object online but can't find anyone selling anything similar to it and the videos online do not look like my video or the object we saw. On the drive home I uploaded the video I took of the UFO, now most of my videos are of animals so this one was a little out of place but by morning had thousands of people emailing, messaging,  commenting on the video asking questions trying to figure it out. A number of large UFO and paranormal Youtubers reached out to me to use the footage on their shows and podcasts! It was really cool and a lot of fun and I was asked to be interviewed for a show on the travel channel which I did and was also a lot of fun.] =",recalled, re,recalled

            [I live with my brother. We live in my mother's house that was left to us. It is big enough for both of us and has no rent or mortgage, so we live here. My brother has a child, my nephew. My nephew spends half his time living her and half living with his mother. The mother lives in a different city (not far, just a 30 or so minute drive) with her parents. I always had fun playing with my nephew but always knew I would only have a limited time to do so because he would have to live elsewhere to go to a decent school. I always thought my brother and the mother of his child had a good relationship. I don't know if they were ever officially married (though there was no wedding) but she uses his last name on her mail. Whenever she visits, she always ended the visit by telling my brother ""I love you"". But recently, I've noticed my brother spending a lot of time with a different woman. I say ""spending a lot of time with"" but it is clear they are dating. I don't really care about the relationship between my brother and the woman who gave birth to his child. However, seeing his relationship with this new woman gave me a bad feeling because I knew it would put my opportunity to see my nephew in Jeopardy. I've lived with my nephew since he was born. I watched him grow up, watched his personality began to develop. I grew very fond of him, though it is easy to grow found of a child. But I felt like I wouldn't be able to see him anymore if things continued. So one day, my nephew's mother found out about my brother's relationship with another woman. She didn't cry or scream like you see people do on tv or hear your neighbors do. She just took her son as usual. But she said she wouldn't bring him back. And so just like that, the little boy I've spent the last 5 years doting on and playing with was taken away. I am not close with his mother or her family, in fact I don't know her number or address, so I cannot go and visit. I just have to accept that my days playing with my nephew have ended.] =",recalled, imag,imagined

            [About 2 months ago I went to the hospital for an ultrasound.  I was 7 days overdue in my pregnancy and we wanted to see what was going on.  For a while I felt as if I were leaking fluids but the doctors assured me I was not.  We sat in the waiting room of the hospital - my daughter, my fiance, and myself - and waited to be called back.  The waiting room of the ultrasound department was always busy - lots of women and men waiting to be seen and wait times upwards of an hour and a half.  My appointment had been scheduled for 3 but it was nearly 5 pm when I was finally called in.  They dimmed the lights in the exam room and proceeded to take measurements.  The nurse remarked that my amniotic fluids looked a bit low.  Otherwise, the  baby looked well.  She said she would call my midwives and see what they wanted to do.  She was gone for sometime and when she came back she told me that they wanted to induce me and that I was likely not shocked.  She was wrong.  I was not expecting to be induced and I was not expecting to stay at the hospital that very day.  They whisked my away to another room and began to process the admittance forms.  I would deliver my son at 330 am the next day.] =",recalled, re,recalled

            [This summer I went to San Diego with my friends to celebrate a birthday.  We out to downtown and went out to eat then we went to a couple of bars and we had an amazing time.  We were all pretty drunk but we were still respectful of others and was just having fun.  We are all kind of old to be staying too late and we were all pretty beat so we decided to hit back to our hotel even though the clock hadn't struck midnight yet.  All 8 of us cramped into the hotel elevator including another man in a suit.  Just as the elevator door was beginning to close my drunk friend decided to stick his finger out at the very last moment.  Not surprisingly, the elevator was jammed and we were stuck in there.  The man in the suit yells at my friend for being an idiot and now we were going to spend the rest of New Years Eve stuck in an elevator. We were all miserable.  30 minutes goes by and still no signs of help yet.  Suddenly, I really had to pee, so did another one of my friend.     We couldn't hold it any longer so we decided we had to go but just as we were unzipping our pants, the man in the suit offered a flask with a jalapeno symbol on it for us to pee in, that made us all laugh and it broke the ice.   The firemen eventually shows up and gets us out of there.  The man in the suit turns out to be the owner of the roof club at the top of the hotel so he invited us to come for free and bought us all shots.  It was one of the most memorable experiences because we all as a group turned a situation around.  It could have been a depressing sad night but we ended making the most of it and had one of the most memorable nights together.] =",recalled, re,recalled

            [Dear Diary,It's only a few weeks until Halloween and Fall is officially here. This is usually my favorite time of year, but this year is different. We have only been in our new house since March and my family is finally starting to get comfortable living back in the city with a neighbor on each side. For the seven years prior we lived out in the country and loved our privacy. We had bonfires every fall, parties, and my kids had the woods to have adventures in. Now that we are in the city my 12 year old son has become noticeably depressed and withdrawn. He doesn't want to go outside or even come out of his room. At first I thought it might be the move, but that is not the issue.   Night before last I asked him to come in my room and have a talk. I asked what was going on with him. He sat there and began to sob and cry. Finally after a few minutes of me reassuring him that there was nothing to big or bad that we can't handle it together. What he told me completely blew my mind. He preceded to tell me about how he has always felt different and then said he felt like he was supposed to be born a girl. I tried not to let my jaw hit the floor. I asked him to elaborate and he said that he had felt that way for a long time but was afraid to say anything. He then told me that he would preferred to be called by a female version of his name and would like for us to refer to him by that name and by the pronoun she. I hugged her and told her we would do whatever we could to make her be comfortable and if that was calling her a different name or anything else that would make exploring this easier for her. Honestly it is one of the hardest things I have faced with any of my three children. I consider myself to be open-minded and progressive, but when it's your child, all of that goes out the window. I love all of my children and have always assured  them that there is nothing we can't face together. So now it's time for me to back that up with action. I want to help her be comfortable with who she is regardless of what gender she identifies with, but I at the same time my heart breaks for the painful journey that I know she faces. People are mean and while society is more accepting than it used to be, it's still scary. I have no idea what the future holds for us, but I will do my best to support my child and do whatever it takes to ensure her safety while she figures out who she is!] =",recalled, imag,imagined

He's being unreasonable. She's eighteen years old and more than capable of handling the job. I don't understand how her having a job can be a problem for him. He's threatened our very tenuous friendship, and has involved his wife who is also my friend. He has begun to refuse to talk to me, instead sending his ""concerns"" through his wife. His wife, meanwhile, is frustrated that he's begun complaining to her. His wife agrees somewhat that our daughter is capable of doing the job, but would prefer to not have to deal with his complaining. She told me that he is convinced that our daughter will do something completely unacceptable. He thinks she will decide to talk about sex, or have an emotional breakdown. He's also concerned he will personally have to become involved. He's also convinced he will be asked to intervene by their managers. It's frustrating and upsetting for all of us for him to be so irrational. But our daughter seems to take this all in stride, and is doing the job.] =",recalled, imag,imagined

We were fairly confident that the bartender overcharged us. The concert itself was awesome. On the way back home our uber driver essentially hustled extra money out of my friend.

Eventually I went back to my aunts house the following day and met up with my mom, and daughter. Finally we drove home.

People were rude, they were bumping into me at the store and not even taking the time to say excuse me. As I collected my necessities for the week and I went to the check out line I noticed a young women and her two children. She was about 25 or so and her children could not have been more than a few years old each. She was young but had the weathered look of someone who was struggling a bit. Her kids were driving her crazy and I could tell she just wanted to get home. Anyways as she is going to pay she sticks her credit card into the machine and it's declined. She tries another card and it's the same result. Again and again for what seemed like an eternity. This lady with her two kids and a cart full of groceries was holding up the line and I could tell things were going to come to a head. She finally breaks down and starts weeping. I felt so terrible but as I'm on a budget I was not in the position to help. Finally after about a minute the cashier swipes his card and says ""don't worry mam, I know how it feels like to struggle."" There had to be at least a hundred or so dollars worth of groceries and I'm sure this cashier wasn't getting paid much more than $10 an hour. To take your days pay and to help out a stranger was one of the most touching things I've seen. She gave this cashier a big hug and she went about her day.

I had worked for the previous 3 years to build up my classes and program. I had invested countless hours, tears, and a mountain of effort into this job and these students. I truly cared about them, and they knew it and cared about me as well. During my time as a teacher, I felt more as though my students were my coworkers than the other teachers. There were some students that I communicated with more than my own family at times. It broke my heart to tell all of them that I wouldn't be returning to school next year. I picked a day when I would see each of my 6 sections of classes, and told each class, one by one, sometimes through tears. I explained that the decision had nothing to do with them and everything to do with low teacher pay. They understood my situation completely. Teachers are underpaid and overworked.

            [This year is the 5th anniversary of the death of my cousin whom I was very close with. She was 30 years old when she passed away suddenly. She passed away only 4 months after our grandmother passed away. So her mom (my aunt) not only lost her mother but also lost her only child all within a few months. My aunt was trying her best to keep her head above water and grieve in her own time and way but she completely let grief take her over. I had been witnessing a steady decline in her mental health the past few years and her behavior getting more erratic and manic and suspected that she was self-medicating. This became clear around Christmas time this year when she was staying with our family for the holiday and she was inebriated so much that she did not realize that she had accidentally turned on the gas on the gas stove in the middle of the night. Luckily my brother smelled the gas and remedied the situation. So that incident told me that she was not doing well at all. Then a couple of months later in the spring she had a complete mental break. Which in a way was what she needed I think, as much as it pained me to see her like this. I think she finally needed to break and hit rock bottom and scare herself to realize how much she had not been dealing with her grief. We had long talks about this, she and I, and she admits that she had not actually been dealing with her grief even though she thought she was and doing it to the best of her ability. We started sharing our travels of grief and I confided in her that I had gone to grief therapy, which she knew was a huge step for me because I have been against myself (only myself) going to therapy since I was made to go to family counseling against my will when I was younger. I told her how angry I had become after losing both my grandmother and my cousin and that anger was how grief had manifested in me. I also told her that it was OK to let grief in even though it is so painful. The more you push it down the worse it will be to overcome later. She worked hard to pull herself up to a ""standing position"" and is since doing much better and has found a great community to support her and seems to be getting back on her feet.] =",recalled, re,recalled

            [Several months ago, I lived in what could only be described as a haunted house. It was located in Southern Colorado. My husband and I were needing a home and looking for a rental property, and this was a charming old house that was built in the late 1800's. Our landlord disclosed to my husband (not to me), that a previous tenant had committed suicide shortly before we were to move in. Knowing that we were already locked in and ready to move, my husband decided not to tell me about the situation for fear I would back out of the deal. It wasn't until we moved in and were settled that he shared the secret with me. The room that the tenant had killed herself in was my new office, and I had always had trouble breathing in there. There is no way to describe it other than the air was constantly sucked out of the room, so that if you were in there for any length of time with the windows and door closed, you literally could not breathe and would feel very faint, as though you needed oxygen or were going to black out. The first month we lived there, we would leave the light over the sink in the kitchen on. It would cut out at several second intervals throughout the night, which I could always see from my position in the bedroom while trying to go to sleep. It would render the house completely dark, and was unnerving. We decided to move out after two months because of the...unrest...that was felt there. Everyone who came into the house could feel the heaviness and the difficulty breathing. IT turned out that the previous tenant had overdosed, purposely, on Klonopin and suffocated in her sleep. This lack of being able to breathe was the most terrifying and memorable event from living there. I still believe this house was haunted.] =",recalled, imag,imagined

I don't know if I said it to avoid the awkward silence or if I meant it. I really have only a few firsthand memories of my father growing up, all of which were positive. My mom always spoke poorly of him. I think I just believed he was this druggie/alcoholic loser that she made him out to be although I never saw him drunk or stoned that I was aware of. He lived out of state most of my life. From what I've been told, my parents eloped in Vegas after I was conceived and divorced before I was a year old. My mom never remarried or really even dated. But now that I'm getting to know him more, I'm learning there's a lot more than the labels my mom put on him and ingrained into my head. I'm kind of angry I never got the opportunity to learn this sooner. I remember always being afraid to ask for things without fearing some form of guilt relating to my father. When I was in middle school, I really wanted to play the saxophone. I worked up the courage to ask my mom. Per usual, she would tell me it was too expensive and to ""ask your father"". I was mentally punished for who my father was my entire life but I didn't even know him. Now that I'm getting to know him more as an adult, I wholeheartedly agree that I am a lot like him (looks, personality, etc.). I was always the black sheep of the family, so it's legit mind boggling to me to have so much in common with a relative for like the first time ever. I call him by his first name. I don't know if I'll ever adjust to calling him ""dad"" but I do remember I would dream of having a dad in my life as a kid.

            [There has been many memorable events in my lifetime but the one that has stuck out to me is that three months ago I finally turned 30 years old. To be honest I was scared to think that I was going to leave my bright and peppy twenties to enter the dreaded thirties and that my life was going to change drastically. Its like those scenarios you build up in your mind where you could imagine the worst possible thing happening to you and then it does. I didn't like that I would let myself think like that because intellectually I knew that turning one year more shouldn't really effect my overall out look on life but as with everything that involves a human being with emotions and sentiments] =",recalled, imag,imagined

            [One night in June, I went to the gym to burn off some excess energy and clear my head so I'd fall asleep more easily. I came home from the movies to find my mother sitting on the sofa with a glass of wine on the coffee table, watching TV. She asked me how the gym was, as if that's something that she'd understand since she's the laziest person I know when it comes to exercise, and she sounded a little drunk. I could also smell wine from 10 feet away in the kitchen, and noticed an empty bottle on the counter. She'd drank the entire thing during the time before I left and while I was gone. She tried to ask me about my day when I realized she was totally drunk. Despite feeling great about having just worked out, my mood immediately shifted from being slightly annoyed about her having happy hour while I was away to livid about her being wasted for no apparent reason. I told her not to talk to me and she asked why] =",recalled, imag,imagined

            [About three months ago, my husband and I were quite worried about what path we should take in life. He moved to Canada from South Korea for me, giving up his career and his family. I was living at home and working just over 25 hours a week at my parents' company due to mental health issues. I felt hopeless and really depressed, unable to imagine myself being able to become independent. I wasn't healthy enough to get a ""real"" job but I wasn't sick enough to get disability assistance from the government. I almost felt like there wasn't a point in living. There was so much I wanted to do in life, but I really couldn't see a way to achieve them. What's the point in trying to save money just so I can survive? I was sick of feeling so helpless so I started looking online for jobs I could do. I didn't have much hope that there was anything that could actually help my situation. However, I was desperate enough that I would accept tasks for lower than minimum wage if I could earn a few extra hundred dollars a month. Even one hundred extra a month would take a burden off of me. I didn't dream that I could get accepted into a long-term work position when those jobs seemed scarce and there must be so many more people who are more qualified than I am. At this point, I felt like I had nothing to lose so I just put together a mediocre CV and applied for the job. I didn't keep my hopes up and decided to forget about it. To my surprise, I got an email less than a week later. I was accepted into a position where I could earn a minimum of four hundred dollars a month and I would be able to do the job while working at my physical part-time job! The ""event"" of being hired may not even be considered an event for many people, but for someone who felt hopeless and depressed, it meant a lot to me. I felt like I could finally gain independence and be less of a burden on my family. My family has noticed I've become more bright and motivated to do things. Working harder is definitely stressful too, but it's now a different kind of stress. Now, I feel a little more hopeful for the future.] =",recalled, imag,imagined

            [I recently watched the online live feed of an aquaintance on FB who sells costume jewelry in her spare time.  There was a prize awarded to one random viewer.  I was lucky enough to win .  The prize was a small selection of the jewelry that she sells.  I was very pleasantly surprized when I found out that I won.  I often enter contests and giveaways like this and I never win.  The jewelry is not expensive, but it is very attractive and it was a nice set that I won.  There were 2 necklaces, 2 pairs of earings, and 2 bracelet sets in the selection.  It was a good pick me up for me as I was having a bit of a difficult week at the time.  I used to be very sceptical about entering contests because I never won.   Now I feel like I am more likely to win.  I think the possibility of winning is something nice to look forward to.  I am going to continue to enter contests and look forward to possibly winning.  If I don't win, I will know that someone else had the pleasant experience of being the winner.  The contests are free and it doesn't hurt to try.  Maybe one day I could even win a large or expensive prize.] =",recalled, re,recalled

            [I remember like it was yesterday still. I had just graduated high school and had a party for this celebration. My brother was acting lazier than usual and was just down right slow. I remember giving him crap left and right and saying how mad I was. A week later I got the call. He was sick and had cancer they told us. I remember still hearing those words and felt so crappy about it. I wish I could go back and take the words back on what I said. Things were wrong between us. I couldn't look him in the eyes anymore. I felt so crappy and still remember those feelings. I would go and visit him and think how crappy I was to him. He would apologize for this and I would apologize and cry to him. This went on and on and finally I was able to save his life with my bone marrow. I really felt better at that point. Now years have passed and I am thankful for this.] =",recalled, imag,imagined

            [I recently found out from from my mom, that my uncle has terminal cancer. o This is HORRIBLE! The guy is like a father to me, and I'm not really sure whats gonna happen now, how I'm supposed to feel, and act. Growing up without a dad sucked, but having my uncle there, almost all the time was like having a dad around. The worst part about it is no one expected anything like this. He seemed like he was in just about perfect health, other than coming down with a minor cough. According to my mom, he's had the cough for a few weeks, and since it wasn't really getting better at all he went to the urgent care. They ran some tests, like normal, then called him the next day, and told him he needed to go to the hospital immediately. The hospital obviously ran more tests, and now says that the cancer is literally from his neck to his waist. They suspect it started in his lungs, and are blaming it on his smoking. They said a few days ago that he 3 to 6 months left to live. What really makes me mad about the whole thing is my mom keeping it a secret from me till a few days ago. She knows how close we are/were, and I understand not wanting to upset me. But its just kinda messed up in my opinion.  I'm pretty upset with her at the moment, but I guess thats the least of my worries right now. She should have told me though. Anyways, I'm going up to the hospital to see him in a few days, thankfully my wife is coming with me. I'm not really sure how I'm going to handle this in the moment. For now, I'm just gonna try and hold it together, and hope for the best I suppose.] =",recalled, imag,imagined

            [I have been living on my own for about 2 years now. Since both of my parents passed away I got myself my own apartment, a new job, a new partner. Things have been hard to adjust but I have made things work. Financial struggles have been a norm for me. While I am able to have small things like a few video games, some DVDs and stuff I really don't get to have much fun with all I work. My birthday was this past August. To my surprise I had several packages delivered that day. All of them were gifts from various friends and family! One package was some brand new clothes. Another package had a really cool Figma statue of Link from the Legend of Zelda. A new cell phone was in a box, cheap, pre-paid, but exactly what I needed as my old one had seen better days. Another box had a couple new Switch games in it. However the big box is what surprised me the most...it was a brand new X Box and a new laptop for work! I had never had an X Box before and was really surprised someone would spend that much on me. My friends all chipped in together and got me  these things as a big cheer up/ birthday surprise. They all knew how hard I had been having it of late and really came through and made my day special. I felt so loved and so accepted by everyone and I don't know if I can ever repay them for their kindness. Getting the laptop makes doing mTurk so much better for me now s it is one of my income sources. I love my friends and I hope I can do nice things for them soon.] =",recalled, imag,imagined

            [July 20th 2018, is a day that will remain present in my mind. I was preparing breakfast, when my mother called and said she was not feeling well, to please email her employer in her behalf since she seemed to not be able to look at the computer or phone screen for too long without having a serious dizzy spell. i did as she asked, email her employer, and decided to spend the rest of the day with mom. upon arriving, i immediately noticed my mother had red dots all over her left side, not chicken pox dots but capillary pain/stressed dots. she then told me she had no movement in her left arm and her lower back was hurting, her lower back had never hurt to that extent. i made the decision of taking her to the emergency room. i filled all of the paper work, asked what was her symptoms and as soon as i explain what she was feeling a team of nurses and doctors rushed her in to a room, i was asked to wait outside. the moment ive seen more than 4 medical professionals rush my mom into a room, i felt like my entire being had shattered, i felt this overwhelming sensation all over my body as if i was loosing control of the situation and did not know if to cry, pace, talk to someone. a nurse came with me and said my mom ER doctor wanted to speak to me, the ER doctor said my mother was experiencing a stroke. signed all of the paper work, while all i wanted to do was crawl into my moms bed and tell her everything was going to be okay, pinching myself that wasnt happening. called my brother, he immediately arrived and we both had each other for support. the doctors order a series of test that took a total of 3 days. on the final day, we were waiting to see what life was going to look. unbeknownst to us we received the best news any kids whose mother had been diagnosed with a stroke could ever receive, my mother did not have a stroke but rather had 70% rotator cuff tear! i felt like my knees gave out. i was overwhelmed with joy. though it was a serious tear it was nothing to what was happening before. In that moment i realized how much i needed my mom, i needed her to be okay. in that moment i realized how blessed we were to have a healthy mom with all of her functions and capabilities. in a instant i felt i had lost half of my mom to feeling i had regain her. as i type this i feel the anxious feelings i was feeling in the moment radiating from my chest and enveloping the rest of my body.] =",recalled, re,recalled

            [When I had my worst period in my 22 years of age, it was the year that I did not leave the house for more than 8 months. A routine of getting up to watch the roof eat and go back to bed, my self-esteem and consciousness were fragile at that time. With that situation for a person so active in social or sports activities, it was a very strong blow to my lifestyle. My mother at that time offered to serve me in the church, I was not very comfortable with the idea but I had no argument to deny her so I decided to give it a try and enter the production area to learn to put together event lights. From there I began to meet great people who have been every blessing in my life. From that moment on every Sunday I attended to learn faster in my service area, I talked with everyone in the church to meet them in addition to spending my free time simply enjoying the free coffee service. All the activities that the church was attending without hesitation since it wanted to see in its entirety as the community towards its goals and objectives with these activities. as once we went to a hospital after a sharing among all church servers to give our patients time to chronic diseases. Seeing their reactions and their stories was pleasant and makes a difference in your way of thinking towards the world and towards yourself. In addition, the church moved to a new terrain towards which I have been able to witness its growth from 0 to date. which gives me a very strong sense of belonging to the community. In addition to building stronger ties with people and living unique experiences with them while we build a place for those who seek help and peace. To date I am really happy and comfortable and able to solve the problems that life presents. There is still much to solve but I no longer feel anxiety if I don't get excited to see the result of my future actions. No more to add until the next story in the newspaper.] =",recalled, re,recalled

            [A memorable event in my life that happened recently is when I was inducted into the International Honor Society of Nursing. This actually just happened 2 days ago. I am a senior in college majoring in nursing, and have worked hard the past 3 years to do well in my classes and get good grades. As a result, I have a high GPA (3.9) and so I was eligible to join the Honor Society. It started with an email sent to me inviting me to join. Once I decided to join, I signed up online and paid the fee. What was extra special was that my parents offered to pay the fee for me because they knew it was important for me to join and they wanted me to be recognized for all my hard work. Then, this past Monday was the induction ceremony. I was a little disappointed because my parents were unable to attend, but two of my friends came instead. I dressed up in a nice dress, picked up my friends, and we went to the ceremony. There was a speaker who presented her research project, and then it was time for the induction. One of my professors read off all of our names (only 7 people in my class were invited to join), and we all went up individually to sign our names in the booklet, receive a certificate, and receive purple cords that we will wear at graduation. Afterwards we took pictures and ate cake. It was a really special night and it was nice to be recognized for my hard work. I appreciated my friends coming to support me. I am proud of myself for this accomplishment and for almost making it through nursing school.] =",recalled, re,recalled

            [A memorable time that comes to mind, is my sons birthday. He really wanted to go away for his day but we just didn't see it being financially possible. Somehow, my husband and I managed to get our funds in order and we were able to take the family to Disney. He was so excited. And to top it all off, he even got to eat at Cinderella's castle on the morning of his birthday. I am not sure who was more thrilled- him or I! We got to go to quite a few Disney parks and do some cool things. In Disney Springs we went on a hot hair balloon which was really neat! We also went to dinner and afterwards went on a vintage car ride in the water. It lasts about 20 minutes but it was quite unique to say the least. Some new things like Disney's new Toy Story land were a big hit. It was our first time there since they added all of that. The slinky dog ride was awesome and worth the VERY long wait.  I definitely won't forget this day and I know he won't either. Putting a smile on my child's face just means the world to me. I am so happy we were able to go. Not only for his birthday, but also to finally take a much needed family vacation. It's been quite awhile since we moved and I had to start working more hours. Although this day wasn't my birthday, it sure was a memorable day!] =",recalled, re,recalled

            [A few months ago my father who was diagnosed with Cancer passed away. Although it was something I knew was coming. It hit me very hard because I was far away in New York and I felt devastated not being able to say goodbye. It was and is the most shocking and painful experience in my life, mostly because I was told he had a few more months to live. Ever since I was little, my dad meant the world to me and I'm unsure how to cope with the loss. Adding to the event my abusive mother was around all the time abusing him and myself till the very last day. I've been trying to cope with this emotional moment with professional help. Distracting myself with other things that can help me move on. He had metastatic cancer diagnosed when it was already stage 4. I think this was too shocking but also gave me time to say sorry for anything I ever did and say I love you as many times per day as it was possible making sure he passed knowing how much he meant to me. At the moment he passed I was in New York for business. I wish I could go back in time and refuse to travel, I regret not being there the last day. Thankfully I have a brother who was there for him and made him felt loved. Now all I have left are the memories I built in the last months and sadness. Death is an event I have a hard time dealing with and is tougher this time more than ever.] =",recalled, re,recalled

My wife and I are gisting and equally packing some clothes in preparation for a new week.  and the children are busy watching cartoon. And waiting for their lesson teacher to come around and help them with their assignments. I suddenly received a call from my younger cousin that he got a job at Google. it was one of the happiest days of my life as I was really really excited for him. I was so happy and excited because I personally sponsored his academics. right from when he was little and therefore I'm like a father to him. We lost our parents when we were very little.

            [About three months ago me and five friends took a trip to dallas for a convention we had all be looking forward to. We bought the tickets last year about 7 or 8 months ago so for it to finally get here was different. It was even better because two of the friends going i did not get to see often and one had recently moved away. SO we piled 5 people 4 people into my friends car and started the 7 hour drive to dallas. The drive was awful it was hot outside but the company made it not so bad really. We stopped at Bucees and took in the great texas culture getting gas buying food and other things and eventually arrived at our AirBnB. We were the first there and quickly all made sure to choose a room with a single bed in it. Then the others arrived from their flights and it was great and so nice to just see everyone there again and say hi exchange pleasantry's etc. From there we went to the convention center on the first day and stood in a long check in line that made us all want to drive home. But after that it was great seeig all the booths meeting new people relaxing really made it feel like a vacation. That night we all hung out played a drinking game ordered food and really relaxed. Waking up late the next day was expected as we had a bit too much to drink but me and another friend took an uber and went and got some breakfast. The dennys was packed but the pancakes were great. The next day was just as good as the first but without the long checkin lineso we spent the day at the convention center and then went for some food at lunch. We ate  at this great wing restauraunt and had a great time then headed back before going home. That night we found out it was one of our friends birthday so we bought a cake and all sang happy birthday. We hung out at the house played some games and watched movies while having some drinks. Going forward to the last day two friends had to go home but the rest of us spent the day together relaxing and repeating all the last days. Fast forward to monday and it is time for us to head home.

            [My brother and four year old niece came over to visit last week, and it was the first time I saw them in almost a year. My niece had grown so much since then, and was running around, talking up a storm, and asking for someone to play dolls with her. She came dressed in a Frozen 2 princess dress and sneakers, and looked like she was ready for action. She had just gotten some Barbie dolls for her birthday and, as an only child, had no one to play with, so I volunteered. It was incredible to see how smart she was, and how she could figure things out on her own. I hadn't seen her since last Christmas, and with so many family members around, it's a little hard to be with anyone individually. I remember her as a shy little girl who really wanted nothing to do with me, so seeing her break out of her shell this time was such a revelation and joy for me. I was incredibly impressed at how she bounced around from one activity to another, and I had trouble keeping up with her! I only made things worse by giving her a small piece of candy - one little Reese's peanut butter candy and she was hyper! Eventually, my brother showed me a way to calm her down... by letting her watch some videos on YouTube that I had no concept of, but entertained her to no end. She asked to take her shoes and socks off - so polite - and proceeded to spend the rest of her time here as a barefoot little angel. After that, we did some coloring, and played with her dolls some more. It was all too soon that her dad was telling her it was time to go home, but she didn't want to! She said she wanted to stay there and play with me... something that touched me so dearly! I was so appreciative that I was able to have such an effect on her! We promised she could visit again soon, and they left, also wishing she could stay a little longer. I was glad I was able to bond with my niece for the first time.] =",recalled, re,recalled

I could not function at work or home. My kids were upset, she was like an aunt to them. It was honestly one of the worst things I ever went through. One of the worst things for me was how I learned about her passing. I was so hurt that her family did not call me. I just didn't understand how someone who was like a sister to me could just be gone, and I had to find out by my boss. Since she was so young, they did not release her body for burial until 2 weeks later. Her husband held the funeral a week later. It has been a very difficult month since the funeral. I often pick up my phone to call or text her. I have read through our text messages so many times that I have them memorized.] =",recalled, re,recalled

We locked eyes and I have never seen him so proud and happy. It was our own special moment. That look is something I will never forget.

            [I experienced a recent health scare involving my elderly stepfather. Lately, he had been acting strange, quiet and absent-minded. At first we were a bit worried but then he started getting headaches and this is a man who never gets headaches. It became apparent something was wrong when he was sitting at the computer complaining that he forgot how to log into Amazon. I looked and saw he wasn't even on the Amazon login page. I told my mother to call his doctor right away. They recommended we take him to the emergency room but he insisted he was fine and didn't want to go. My mother refused to take him so I threatened to call 911 because I felt she wasn't taking it seriously. We had an all-out shout fest over it while she insisted ""people have a right to refuse medical treatment."" Since he is a disabled veteran and her only source of support, I reminded her of the risks of doing nothing and that I felt personally responsible if nothing was done about it. Fortunately, the next day my mother managed to talk him into going to the VA hospital and get checked out. Sure enough he has a Subdural Hematoma, which could be quite serious. He is now getting treatment and my mother is glad she talked him into going. I'm also greatly relieved that now they understand not to take these types of things too lightly. That was a pretty scary incident. My folks can be pretty stubborn but I hope this incident will ensure they take their health issues more seriously in the future.] =",recalled, re,recalled

            [I experienced my first train ride with my daughter approximately three months ago.  We rode from Tennessee to Utah to visit my sister and her husband.  Our adventure started in Nashville as a bus trip, and when we arrived in Indiana, we transferred ourselves and our luggage on a train.  The bus trip was a little cramped, but amusing.  A male passenger across from me kept cursing during his phone conversation.  The bus driver had no qualms with correcting the young man's outbursts.  Later during the drive, the bus driver attempted her best to not doze off.  During the last leg of the trip she swerved a few times. To keep herself awake, she started to hum.  The bus driver hummed louder and louder as we progressed closer and closer to the bus/train station.  I was amused to the point of giggling.  My daughter was not.  My daughter didn't get much sleep the night before our trip, and she had hoped she would make up for it during our bus ride.  When my daughter and I ended our bus trip and arrived in Indiana, we experienced a dull four hour layover.  Maybe it was dull because it was the wee-hours of the morning.  But she and I amused ourselves by cracking jokes and making silly comments. After the long four hours, we finally boarded the train and had begun our cozy and adventurous ride to Utah.  Our first stop was in Chicago.  My daughter and I had to transfer ourselves and our luggage to another train.  The customer service gentleman who assisted us with the transfer was kind, comedic and inquisitive.  He and I exchanged jests and sarcasms after he made an inquiry concerning our reasons for going to Utah.  The customer service gentleman also joked about the size of my daughter's luggage.  He stated that he was sure that he would be able to fit inside of the suitcase and tag along with us.  My daughter and I were refreshed by the comical exchange with the customer service gentleman.  After transferring our luggage, my daughter and I discovered the food court in the train station ate a delicious meal, and then made our way to the Chicago train station waiting area to begin the last half of our adventure.] =",recalled, re,recalled

            [My brother was married recently. It was a monumental task getting him to the alter. Not because he weighs 400 pounds, but because he lives in a balloon above the lakehouse. He is also lactose intolerant. Once we found a contemporary moo-moo to suit the occasion we settled on a caterer who worked with all vegan cheese and could even make a poutine. Well my brother is also a cheapskate and ""forgot"" to pay the caterer. Right before the ceremony began there was a knock at the door and some lovely hors d'oeuvres were delivered on a large platter. My brother took one look at the vegan cheese balls and dug in. Smugly he reminded me that this is why you never pay for things. Later, while waiting for the ceremony to begin I noticed my brother shifting uneasily. ""I think there was something wrong with those cheese balls"", he says. I had my suspicions about the lactose content of the vegan cheese balls but remained stoic. As the bells chimed and the union was formally announced for the first time the bride and groom were to walk down the aisle and out into the open air. Only my brother never made it that far. He started to walk at an almost frantic pace, practically dragging his new bride in his efforts to get out of the church. It was all for nothing though, as he tripped on the roll of red carpet he had wanted rolled out and collapsed in agony as he let out of massive fart. People were aghast, speechless, dismayed. One lady sprinted for the door. All in all it was a good wedding.] =",recalled, imag,imagined

            [There's no really good way to find out your Mom has cancer. But a note in your birthday card is up there with really bad ways to find out. Especially when it arrives the day before your birthday and you had big plans. A trip out of time, tickets to a concert and nice hotel room suddenly seemed about as appealing as a plate of rotten fish. My Mom has always been there for me through all my mistakes and failures. Always trying to help, although never really having the right words. But just knowing that at least one person was one my side was usually enough to get me through to the next thing. The card and the note hit me like a train. It didn't really say how serious or treatable the cancer might be. So I was left wondering about her health as I  broke the news to my friend going with me that the trip was off. Although I live a short distance from my parents, I don't go over there anymore because of my father being such a jerk. I got tired of the fighting and insults and vowed to never set foot there again. My brother had wisely made the decision 25 years earlier, so I knew he would have no info either. I was filled with dread and fear as I picked up the phone to call.  They say no news is good news, but not so much when it's your Mom's health. Of course my call goes to voicemail, which further increases my anxiety. The next day my Mom calls me back to say that she has a tumor but they think they will be able to operate and remove it. Fortunately they don't find any cancer in the bloodstream or lymph nodes. Having been through a breast cancer scare with my best friend a year early I knew this was a good sign. Yet still I was mostly paralyzed with a foreboding sense of doom and a real trepidation that my biggest supporter in life might not be around too much longer. As each day ticked off until the operation I could barely think of anything else and could barely get any work done. When it was over, the doctors said that they were very successful in getting the tumor out, and they had no concern that it had spread but chemo would still be necessary.] =",recalled, imag,imagined

            [Over the summer in June my father reached out to me and wanted to plan a road trip to Yellowstone National Park. This was a big deal because I have not spoken nor seen my father in over 10 years. The last time we spoke, we were not on the best of speaking terms due to some differences we had when I was still living in the same area that we had. I was pretty stunned that he had even called me and wanted to do something with me. Even more, he had invited my girlfriend of 6 years who he had never met. I never gave him a direct answer during the first call because I was shocked. I wanted to talk it over with my girlfriend and my therapist to see if this was even a good idea. I was slightly worried that it could conjure up some past animosity that I have harbored since I was a kid. Both my girlfriend and therapist said I should definitely follow up with my dad and agree on the trip. The next several weeks were very nerve wracking for me and I could not stop thinking about how the trip would go. When we finally met up in Cheyenne, Wyoming, my emotions were all over the place. I was so nervous my stomach hurt. My dad gave me a hug and said he was excited to ""get the show on the road"".  We had a great trip and talked for hours each day while driving to a new destination in the park to check out. My dad and I rekindled our relationship and it was a week that I will never forget. I now finally feel like I have a father and it makes me feel happy.] =",recalled, re,recalled

            [In June I had to have my dog put to sleep. Her name was Ginger. She was twelve and a half years old. This was a decision I had been dreading for weeks. For a basset hound, Ginger was usually rather spry. Around March of this year she began to spend most of her either in her bed or curled up next to me on the couch. I attributed her behavior to old age, and the vet agreed. He could find no illness or injury. Over the coming weeks she became progressively weaker until she was unable to walk. Her breathing was increasingly labored. I delayed the decision for as long as I could. On June 22, I carried her, bed and all, to the car and drove her to the vet.  He agreed that she would not recover and felt that ending her suffering was the correct decision. Throughout, Ginger was as alert and affectionate as ever. This made everything more difficult for me. I was certain that I was doing the right thing, but sometimes the right thing really sucks. Ginger was a playful, smart, and affectionate dog. She was a wonderful companion and definitely a member of the family. I will miss her greatly for a long time.] =",recalled, imag,imagined

            [We traveled to visit my brother in another state. There was a family fishing contest and we decided to go. My children went fishing for the first time with us. My brother and I taught them how to cast their lines, bait a hook, and watch for bites. We spent the afternoon at this contest at a private fishing lake out in the countryside. My kids are suburban kids and not used to being out in nature, so this was a new and fun experience for them.  I grew up in the country so it was incredibly rewarding to see them enjoying something  like that. Within being there just a few minutes, my son caught his very first fish! He was so excited. We helped him reel it in and hold it up for pictures. The other kids all gathered around and touched the fish. They helped toss it back into the water. Not long after, my eldest daughter caught her first fish. We didn't win the contest, we were just there for fun. However, it was just a really great experience to share with my kids.] =",recalled, re,recalled

            [A couple of weeks ago my family went camping like we normally do during the Summer. We LOVE camping but there was something extra special about this trip- well, two things actually. The first one being that my brother was leaving a couple days later to move back to California for work. The second thing is that my uncle was going to come meet us at camp and stay for the day. I am from a small town in California called Paradise, that was decimated by wildfire last year. My uncle moved to Washington after the fire and I moved to Idaho ( I was not living in Paradise at the time of the fire though so thankfully I didn't lose my home or anything like that). Anyway, like I said my uncle was going to meet us at camp. I was so incredibly excited for this because I had not seen him in about 11 years! When we got to camp I did not have cell phone service so I was unsure as to whether or not he would actually make it (camp was a 1 and a half hour drive from his home). I was so excited to see him walking up that I nearly started to cry. I ran to him, barefoot through the woods, and gave him the biggest hug ever! There are no words to accurately describe that moment. It's like gaining a family member back in your life that you thought was gone forever. We hadn't seen each other in that long because I had moved to Reno, Nevada about 8 years prior and we just sort of lost touch over the years. My uncle is someone who I have always looked up to so seeing him was extra special. We sat by the lake, enjoyed lunch, and caught up on all the time we had missed. I am so very excited to have my uncle back in my life. While it was bittersweet because at the same time as that visit, I realized I was saying goodbye to my brother (he is now in California nearly 14 hours away from me in North Idaho), it was so fulfilling to see my uncle. You just never know where life will take you and who can unexpectedly come back into your life when you aren't anticipating it. I miss my brother since he moved, but I have my uncle back. I am so excited to spend more time with him, catching up, and him getting to know my family.] =",recalled, re,recalled

But this day my family and friends decided to throw me a surprise party. I was in total shock, never expected s surprise party. It started off like a typical day waking and getting ready for work. I had plans to have dinner with my significant other that night. After work came home and got ready for dinner. When we got to the restaurant he provided them his name and they said that they had a special table for us in the back. The back room was usually only used for special occasions. When we walked in through the hallway to the back room it was full of my friends and family. We had a nice dinner and there was a DJ playing music, so we enjoyed a little dancing. I have such wonderful family and friends and getting to enjoy my 45 birthday with them was fantastic. I can't imagine having a nicer birthday. We enjoyed good food , good music and wonderful company. After hours of enjoying ourselves it was time to leave. I hated that the night had to end.] =",recalled, re,recalled

            [6 months ago I was patched in to my motorcycle club.  I had been prospecting for a year at that point.  The greatest thing about it was that it was a surprise I was not expecting.  We were visiting another chapter out of town and as prospects we sat outside during the main meeting.  Partway through I was called in front of the club and they started asking me question after question.  I was nervous and firing answers as fast as I could.  Eventually someone came up behind me and took off my cut and I didnt know what to do.  As I turned around I had a beer dumped over my head and I immediately knew what was going on.  As the others joined in I knew this was one of the greatest days of my life.  It marked the completion of a year plus of hard work and a goal I had been pushing for.  Everything seemed to happen in slow motion after that.  My head was spinning with thoughts.  I couldnt help but smile and almost cry at the same time.  I was handed a set of full patches and told to put them on my cut ASAP.  I had them on in 5 minutes and could not believe the feeling.  I was riding an emotional high the whole way home and for some time after.  It is still one of the greatest days of my life being welcomed into this brotherhood.] =",recalled, re,recalled

It was great projects and we were able to make it successful. Every afternoon we have a lot of activity for both kids and adults it was fun, we enjoy every bit of the event of it. We all happily shared the word of God and the foods. Everybody did participate real good. We also have a lot of games and prizes all kids enjoyed it, 1 full week don't seem enough for each on of us. We had different groups for all ages from toddler up to the old ones. It was indeed a blast, it was the first of many more to come. We are looking forward to make it more enjoyable and memorable every year. We all trying to make our church active again like it used to be when we were young. I am glad that we were given a chance to make our church alive again for our kids and next generation. Hoping for more projects next year again. And happy to see that our community is inflating. My kids had so much fun that they are really excited going to church now. And  because of the events people in the community was become more closer  to each other.

My wife knew about it before I did. We waited until I got home to tell the kids. The kids were very excited. The vacation was at a Universal Studios resort for 6 nights. It included a meal package as well to all of the amusement parks. We had to decide on an exact date so we started getting everyone's schedules together. It was going to be hot but August was the choice! It was too expensive to fly so we chose to drive. Took us 10 hours to get there. Weather was very nice. We went to the big water park first, Volcano Bay. The kids loved it. The next day we stayed and hung out at the resort and swam in the pool mostly. We played some games and went bowling. Next two days we went to Universal Studios park and then Adventure Island. Adventure Island was my favorite. THey had a bunch of Marvel themed restaurants and rides. The vacation was awesome.

So, I thought I would feel very nervous. But surprisingly, I stayed calm. There was a lot of good, fun, and lighthearted conversation. He made me laugh throughout the night, which I liked. He seemed to be a bit nervous throughout dinner. So, I wasn't completely surprised when he spilled some of his water onto the table. It was a memorable moment, but we both laughed it off. I think the fact that we laughed it off made him feel less nervous. We talked about work, hobbies, and random topics that were popular in the news. In the end, it was a good date. I had a good time. And, before I even made it home, he texted me to tell me that he had had a good time as well. I was happy about that.] =",recalled, re,recalled

            [Back in late April I got my first full suspension mountain bike. The bike is a used Schwinn. It's an older model, but in really good shape. I have been used to riding hard tail mountain bikes.  I had heard of and seen full suspension mountain bikes, but the prices were out of my reach. Also, I wasn't expecting much of an improvement. I saw full suspension bikes as a kind of gimmick. I figured the bike would not ride as well. I figured the suspension would not have much of an effect. Well, I was wrong. I fell in love with the bike within 5 minutes of riding it. It wasn't long before I discovered that I could ride it for longer. It was less ""hard"" on me than a traditional bike. You still feel the impacts, but a lot of the force is taken out of them. That makes the ride much more comfortable.

            [I recently had a few different drastically life changing events take place. One of which is the beginning of a divorce. After ten years of marriage, my husband decided he wanted a divorce. After some of the awful things he did in our marriage, I was still hanging in hoping we could move past all the hurt and betrayal. But unfortunately, he got fed up with the process and decided to end it. Just within the last three months I have agreed to give him the divorce, had him lash out at me in unspeakable ways, been forced to move due to lack of ability to continue paying for the previous place and had to pick up the pieces for myself and my three young children.

I am still trying to get through this divorce, but I have faith that the Lord will work all this for good. Many other changes have come along with this divorce. Of course the move. The change in family dynamic, which has been the worst and most difficult change. The financial changes. The emotional changes in me, which I struggle with every single day. The coping of my children. Yes, this has been quite the emotional roller coaster. I am still looking to the Lord for daily strength.] =",recalled, imag,imagined

            [Awhile back I went and visited my parents, due to work I had not seem them in a few months. They were all excited to see me and they also told me they wanted to get a new cat. The two cats we had while I was growing up had both passed away recently and I know my mom especially since she works from home 4 days a week had been missing their presence. She was against getting another Cat because it was really painful for her when we put them to sleep to the point where she had almost collapsed in the Vet's office. But I think enough time had passed that she wanted another Cat. So that Sunday morning we ate breakfast and then went to a local Cat shelter to look at some kittens. They had a special room where they kept all the kittens. We saw a whole bunch of kittens in the cages we had but there was one that was especially cute. The people at the shelter took him and his sister out of the cage and put us in a room with the two so we can interact with them. The female kitten was partially rambunctious, while the male one was more meek. My parents then stated they wanted the male one but were not going to take the female Kitten for she was too energetic. They were worried about her climbing everywhere and destroying things around the house. You see our old cats were very calm and docile as well as sweet so they were a but put off by the energy level of the female kitten. We then filled out the paperwork, I tried my best to talk my folks into taking both of them since I felt it was cruel to separate kittens but ultimately they had decided against it. It was really great to see my mom that happy again, as her days are now much more full with a little kitten running around the house.] =",recalled, re,recalled

            [About one month ago I received full custody of my children. This was a very emotional moment for me because I fought for my children for three years, and as a father looking to gain custody of his children it was very difficult. My children were being abused by their mother, and no matter how much proof I provided the courts, they still allowed her to have primary custody of the children. I have never used drugs in a my life, yet the children's mother was using regularly (that's why we separated) for three years. In order to get ""just"" three weekends a month with my kids, I was forced into taking drug and alcohol tests, anger management, etc.. During this time their mother would routinely violate the order that allowed me to see the children on the weekends. She would curse at me, threaten me, tell me I was trash, all right in front of the children. There was a small period where I honestly started to believe the things she would say to me, almost as if I had accepted that I was trash, even though I was doing everything right. I guess after a while I just started to break down, I was constantly in debt due to the cost of lawyers, and was just mentally drained. Thankfully I had my family to pick up the the pieces for me, and my children to keep motivating me. In January of 2019, their mothers neighbour called children and youth on her, and abuse was found to be taking place in the home, and in the end custody was removed from her, and given to me. The amount of relief I experienced is not measurable. The day I received the order signed by a judge, I just remember breaking down and crying. I dont think I will ever forget that day. Even though I was able to gain full custody of the children, I still hold sort of an resentment against the legal system. I honestly do believe if I was not a man trying to gain custody of his children, and the roles were reversed, it would have taken less than six months. I mean from the very beginning I had proof of the abuse taking place, and the courts just did not care. My children are safe, and happy today though. I could not ask for more than that.] =",recalled, re,recalled

Myself and 2 other family members who reside in Michigan decided to drive to the wedding. Because I do not fly on planes due to a fear of flying. We decided to make some fun stops on the way to Florida.  We stopped at a small town store. I bought my granddaughter a very unique gift that was hand made by a woman who was 90 years old. When we arrived in Florida we stayed with a niece in a small quaint house. The wedding was beautiful. I was very surprised that my high school boyfriend from years ago was at the wedding. It was good to see him, and he was doing well. My granddaughter wore my daughter's wedding dress. My granddaughter had some changes made to the dress but it was just as beautiful.

            [One of the most memorable please my life was when I graduated from my graduate school in May 2019. This day which was actually May 16, 2019, was one of the best days of my life for several reasons. Number one, I worked extremely hard to my patient studies to make sure that I graduated in only five years which a lot of people do not do. Because I was able to accomplish this in such a short time, I was extremely proud of myself and I felt that this was one of the greatest accomplishments of my life. I spent many nights in many weekends working extremely hard in the laboratory doing homeworkâÃÃ´s studying and doing very difficult experiments just to make sure that I had all of the data necessary to graduate. My family and I had to make a lot of sacrifices  during my five years to make sure that I was going to graduate and finish my degree. My family and I knew that this would be a long-term investment so we put all of our resources into it. On that day I feel like I finally had accomplished everything that I want it and I was going to be able to get back to my family. This is why that day was so so significantly memorable for me. I felt that I had to finally achieved one of my major life goals and my family and I were actually together getting this PhD just myself. Today or still remember that day like it was yesterday was a day that IâÃÃ´m going to remember for the rest of my life. It is a day that will live on in our family and something that will actually carry-on to other generations inspire other dinner .I am the first one in my family to obtain an advanced degree and because of this I know that future generations will actually  no that anything is possible. I am looking to inspire future generations of my family and I know that it all starts with my graduation. That PhD degree is going to take me anywhere I want to my career which is why I am so happy that IâÃÃ´ll site able to finish it. I am looking to make a big difference in our world and I know that my degree in my education will allow me to do just that. I donâÃÃ´t see work thatâÃÃ´s just work but I want to have a job that I can have fun and make a really big impact in the scientific world.

            [Over the summer, I helped my mother move into an assisted living facility. She was not happy to go, but at the same time, she knew that she could no longer maintain her own apartment, and needed some help on basic tasks. Moving her out of her home was hard. I was sad as I saw her part with many items that she no longer had room for. I was able to hold onto some items for her, like our family photo albums, which made me feel sentimental about the times when we all lived together and my father was still alive. The assisted living space was nice, but it felt impersonal to me, like moving into a hotel room. I worry that the staff won't take good care of her, that she will be lonely or mistreated. She says she has made some friends, but she still sounds lonely. I can't visit her as often because she doesn't like to sit in the common room and doesn't want me in her room. I take her out to dinner but feel sad when I drop her off.  Seeing her so vulnerable is unusual to me. I have always thought of her as strong. Now it seems I am stronger. Having recently dropped a son at college, I can say this was the opposite experience. In dropping him off, I saw him making his way toward manhood, whereas in moving my mom to the home, I see her becoming more childlike again. This new way of life is difficult for me, though I expect it is more difficult for her, as she has lost her autonomy in many ways.] =",recalled, imag,imagined

His is very much attached to his mom and I, so we were nervous for him being away from us. We figured his natural curiosity would carry him through the day until we would pick him up in the afternoon. We were wrong! The drop-off was tough. We were supposed to bring him in to his cubby, change his shoes to his slippers, and then help walk him over to the gate of his classroom. We saw the wheels turning in his mind - he knew what was happening and he didn't like it. The tears started as soon as he heard other kids starting to cry. He didn't want to let go of us and he looked like he could not understand why were leaving him with the teachers at the school. We were told that we should make a quick exit upon dropping off, so as to not prolong the experience for him, but it was difficult! After we got back to our car and were on our way home, we saw that the teacher had sent us a picture of him in the classroom, already taking an interest to some of the class materials and activities for him. The day was long and when we went to pick him up that afternoon, he looked worse for wear! Even though he looked relieved to see us he started to cry again. The teacher told us he had a fine day and that every day would get a little easier. We trust her, but the process has been difficult so far! It's hard to drop him off (now on his second week) knowing that it is so emotionally upsetting to be left at school in the morning!] =",recalled, re,recalled

We were plopped on our couch and just resting when my wife started a conversation about our future, about having our first baby. I was engaged. We started discussing how he or she would look like, who we want it to look like (LOL), how we will raise our child, and how fun (and simultaneously stressful) it would be to be a parent. It was a very meaningful and satisfying conversation. We normally don't have time available to just sit and talk like that. We live pretty busy lives. But that moment was really significant, because it meant something to us and what our future will be as husband and wife. We talked about how we have been married for over three years already, and we already enjoyed most of our time with just the two of us. It may be time for a new member to join in. We feel quite ready. I told her however if we can wait just a few more months before trying. I just want to have one more special anniversary to spend with her, then we can finally go for it.

I got to the event early and sat there on pins and needles waiting to see who walked in first. I was afraid I wouldn't recognize them or they wouldn't recognize me. I was so very wrong!

We hugged, we laughed, and even a few tears were shed. I can honestly say I was so moved and so very happy to see them all again. We were so close for so long and then time and life intervened. The years flew by and so did that night. We danced, ate, drank and had the best time. This was one of the most emotional times of my life and I'll never forget how I felt and how much fun I had.

            [There is one event that I will never forget for the rest of my life that happened recently. I was working in the labor & delivery floor of Kaiser San Francisco for my nursing rotation. I remember being quite anxious because I was a male, and I assumed that it would be hard to gain experience since women may not like having a male in their delivery rooms. However, it was the opposite of what I expected.  I have always wondered what it would be like to watch the birth of a baby. All I hear are stories from my mom about the stress of it because she had four of us. It all started during my second week on the floor. I met a patient who was due to have her baby on the same day. She was with her husband. I don't remember their names, but I do remember their faces and the entire experience. The nurse I was working with advocated for me to be in the room to assist with the birthing process. I remember how long it took and how tiring it was for the patient to push for over two hours in order for the baby to come out. It was all so beautiful. I was able to help hold one of her legs up while the other nurse held the other leg. When the doctor delivered the baby, I almost cried. It was one of the most beautiful things I have ever seen. Can you imagine being the first person that a baby sees in this world? It was such a joyous experience. I hope one day that I will get to do it again with my own children.] =",recalled, re,recalled

            [I had to learn to walk again. I had broken my ankle in a way that the doctor's thought I was going to lose my foot. I had been out for a walk, and tripped and my ankle just snapped. I was alone, but thankfully a school bus driver pulled over and called 911 and tried to keep me calm while we waited for help. After having surgery and a few casts, I did't think I would ever be able to walk like I did before. I had to go back to the basis with learning to walk. I never realized how hard it was for babies to learn. I thought that I could just get a cane, hop a little and be on my way. That did not happen. I had to have someone walking behind me while I used a walker and took tiny, little steps. I was shocked at how hard it was, and how I had taken being able to get up and walk around when I wanted for granted. My life had completely changed, and while I was taken steps both physically, mentally and literally in the right direction to get it back on track. It was hard and there were many tears and if I could have walked properly, I know I would have stormed off a time or two. But, now months later, why I still walk with a limp most days, I can at least walk. Not how I used to be able to, but I'm thankfully I can at least storm off if I ever need to.] =",recalled, re,recalled

She is amazing person and I wanted to make a good impression.  I know her family is important to her so I was very nervous.  I'm not very talkative or outgoing and she said that her mom is.  The drive itself was about 4 hours and went well.  The weather was cloudy and we met for Mexican for lunch.  I really enjoyed getting to meet them.  We started to walk around and then got caught in a torrential downpour!  It lightened the mood for all of us to get soaked.  Later we had dinner and drinks and relaxed even more.  It was fun to hear about my girlfriend's childhood and meet the folks who raised her.  After dinner we had some wine and played a board game.  By the end, I felt so comfortable that I couldn't believe I had been nervous earlier.  It was a wonderful weekend.

So the two of us decided that it was a good time to try it out. We chose her apartment because the neighbors are less annoying. The day of the move was cold and somewhat rainy. We had been moving boxes and stuff but getting the majority of the last things came all at once. I asked my uncle to help me move my bed. Michele and I were both excited and looking forward to this. We quickly got all of our things moved over and I was setting up my cat a place in a room by herself so she was not overwhelmed. It all went pretty well really. That night we built a fort and played with the cats, she also has two of them. It was really fun, we both enjoyed ourselves. We laughed and had fun all night. We had quite a bit of fun and it really was way less stress than I was thinking it would be. Ended up working out just fine, we get along together very well.

            [I participated in a medical malpractice trial as the second chair.  I was assisting the managing partner of my firm to try the case as a plaintiff against a doctor and a hospital.  The doctor over prescribed our client with opiate medication and nearly killed her on several occasions.  While she never became addicted, the effects of the treatment left her an emotional and physical wreck.  This experience was very fun and stressful at the same time.  I got to learn on the fly trying a very high profile and high dollar case, while at the same time dealing with the stress of trial.  Long nights, working weekends, and the uncertainty of a judge's rulings were all contributing to the stress.  Additionally, defense counsel was very difficult, which the procedure of trying the case nearly impossible.  Our client also had mental problems, which made it tough.  She could be difficult one day, but pleasant the next.  The judge was also very difficult and did not understand the law.  This made her rulings difficult to anticipate, as she did not know what she was doing.  She eventually understood the law, but this made things hard.  She kept pressuring us to settle, which we did not.  However, we were able to persevere and eventually secured a large verdict for our client.  The verdict was featured in the newspaper, which made me proud.] =",recalled, re,recalled

            [July 14, 2019On the morning of July 14th myself, my husband, my brother, my niece and my sister and her husband all decided to hike to the top of Mt. Leconte in the Smoky Mountain National Park.  We had attempted this before but were unable to make it to the top because of an injury to my daughter.  She had had knee surgery in the past and was unable to make it to the top due to her knee pain.  WE were determined we were going to make it this time.  WE started at around 8:00 am that morning.  Although it was very hard because it was up hill the whole way I made it to the top.  Two of our party did not make it to the top but tried their best.  Of the ones who made it, it took us 4 hours to make it all the way to the top.  We were exahausted but elated we had reached our goal!  The way down didn't take nearly as long because it was mostly down hill.  It took about 2 and a half hours to make the journey back to our car.  On our way back down we met up with the two in our party who did not make it to the top although they had made great progress.  They were disappointed and vowed to make it to the top the next time we went.  I really enjoyed our hiking expeirence although it was very taxing.  I would love to try again in the future and see if we can make it to the top faster the next time.] =",recalled, re,recalled

            [On a Saturday afternoon this summer I received a phone call from a good friend of mine. This friend I had known had a drinking problem for many years. I had made many attempts in the past to suggest help for him, but he refused. On this day my friend decided to drink and drive and crashed his car. This day was important to me because it was the day my friend hit rock bottom and decided to get help. On this day my friend went fishing and, unknown to me, he was drinking. I got the phone call from him that he had driven his car in a ditch and needed picked up because he could not get it out. I went to pick him up and we contacted another friend who had a truck and could possible pull his car out of this ditch. Because my friend had been drinking I went with the other friend to try to get the car out of the ditch. After a few hours and some help from some random strangers we were able to pull the car out. It did have damage but was still drivable. After many attempts of trying to convince my friend to get help, this was his breaking point and he realized he needed the help. I was relived that he decided to finally get help for himself. It has been a few weeks of sobriety now and I am very proud of my friend. It is not easy to get over an addiction and takes lots of hard work and dedication. I hope my friend can continue his sobriety.] =",recalled, re,recalled

My last puppy was 17 when she passed on. My son found the new puppy and paid 100 dollar deposit to hold her. We were so excited to welcome this new puppy.  The day finally came that we were going to drive down to get her. It was over 400 miles away that we were going to drive to get her. We got about 200 miles into our trip when the car broke down.

            [I went to the movies to see Detective Pikachu.  I went to the theater just up the street. I went with my boyfriend. It had been about 7 years since I had been to see any movie in a theater because I'm not a huge movie fan in general and I don't like the theater experience.  This was an important event for me because my boyfriend suggested it on his own and it was something special we could share. I have been a fan of Pokemon since the beginning, but for many years I had no one to share it with.  I thought about how when the first Pokemon movie came out almost 20 years ago I had no one to go see it with, and finally having someone to share Pokemon with made me feel so happy and special. The best, most memorable part was when Pikachu got sad and serious in the movie and my boyfriend leaned over to hug and kiss me.  It was a special moment. Also, I hadn't been in a theater in so long I hadn't realized how much they have improved, with the recliners and the assigned seating.  It was so much more comfortable and less cramped.  It was also awesome going to a weekday matinee when almost no one else was there.  It completely changed my view of movie watching.  This reminds me of another top moment.  When we were selecting our assigned seats I found out my boyfriend also likes the front row just like I do.  Most people don't like the front roe in movies.  Having that in common was really cool.] =",recalled, re,recalled

He lives near by and wanted to have a last adventure before he started back to school. He is 14, and started high school a few weeks ago. We drove to the mountains and hiked another mile into the forest where we set up our camp. He set up the tent while I got a fire going. We brought tin foil dinners and cooked them in the fire that evening. We started to roast marshmallows just as it started raining. We retired to the tent where we talked and listened to the rain until we fell asleep. During the night we heard a bear nearby so that was exciting. In the morning we had bacon and powdered eggs and packed up camp. We hiked back to my truck, and stopped to get some firewood on the way home.

            [The first thing that came to mind was what I believed to be a panic attack that happened a couple months. It all started early on a Monday morning at work. Typically Monday and Sunday are the most stressful days for me because of my dislike about being stuck at work for the week and that the weekend had ended. So generally I am at least a little more stressed those days than others. That morning I also had received a couple voicemails about a couple bills that had been paid for a non-profit that I am part of. Looking back it was an honest mistake because we restructured the organization and thus needed to also change the bank accounts. Generally we had a treasurer that took of those things, but once we had restructured he had left so I was in charge. Unfortunately, though I had very little idea as to what accounts we had out there and what we paying for and how we were doing so. But at the time being in the accounting industry it was stressful because in my own life I am very good at paying bills and always worry about missing something. Those calls got my stress level up to a certain point, but elevated even more was realizing that during a transition period of acquiring a person's work I failed to bill a tenant for several months. Even though I talked to my manager about it and we worked it out it still got my stress level up even more and eventually over the edge. It was around noon that I noticed that I was real jittery and issues typing or even talking. Things seemed to be serious to the point that I took of work and went to the hospital. Upon check-in they believed I may have actually had a stroke so they announced a stroke code upon which several doctors came and gave me a blood transfusion and several tests. Once that was all over though I began to calm down and feel much better.  In the end they did a couple radiology tests, which came back negative and they believed I probably did not have a stroke after all. It was only later that after thinking about it more that I thought it was more of a panic attack. So I am trying to do better about managing my stress levels and am thankful that I had been given a clean slate as far as my health.] =",recalled, re,recalled

            [My cousin got married on a Saturday this past May. He had been planning this event for years. He is a perfectionist and usually needs everything to be perfect and just the way he had planned it to be. He does not handle change well. Growing up with him, I remember how he often used to get stressed when we changed plans on him. I knew that his wedding was a big deal for him. He had planned to have a beautiful summer wedding on the river in Chattanooga, Tennessee. The venue he chose was positioned in a perfect location overlooking both the river and the city. He had specifically picked a date in May as he knew that the average temperature during this time was 80 degrees.  However, this precision planning seemed to have backfired on him. That morning I looked outside the window and saw what looked like the coldest and rainiest day in the history of May. There were about fifty people who attended, most wearing summer attire. Families began arriving at the venue and most were still hopeful about having the venue changed.  There were several messages sent out in the family group chat that read, ""What is going to happen with the venue, will it be changed?"" and, ""it is way too cold and wet today, surely this will have to be moved to an indoor venue at least?"".When I arrived at the wedding, I began seconding guessing my cousins decision not to have the venue moved. By then the wind started picking up and it was not a pleasant day at all. The venue as positioned outside next to a river and by then all of the chairs and tables were drenched. Many of the guests began asking about the possible cancellation/relocation of the ceremony. However, my cousin was determined to give his bride the view that she had asked for. To many of the guests amazement, they decided to go ahead and move on with plan A. When we all finally mustered up the courage to go outside, the most unexpected thing happened, the wind had stopped, the clouds opened up, and a ray of warm sun shine shined directly onto the alter, almost as if it were planned. Although the wedding was not exactly perfect,  it was beautiful site and the happy couple were able to enjoy their special day n a ray of sunshine. Everyone was able to breather a sigh of relief at the end. The wedding turned out to be just fine.] =",recalled, imag,imagined

            [About 4.5 months ago, I needed help in paying my bills after a medical emergency. I got into a car crash, and I needed to get a surgery for a broken hip and other broken bones. Not only did I get charged a large medical bill in the tens of thousands, I also could not work for about three months, which also led to me not making at money at the time. I didn't have enough money to pay for the bill, or to even pay for monthly bills since I didn't make any money while I was at the hospital. I cried for days at the hospital and felt depressed, but then something unexpected happened. While I was at the hospital, a co-worker of mine named Jeff heard about my situation, and actually started a donation drive to help pay my bills. The donation drive came from everywhere, not only from my friends and family but people I hardly knew. People from online even donated, when a gofundme page was posted up. When I first saw the money, I wondered how Jeff got the spare cash to pay it out of his pocket, but after he told me, I broke down crying in my hospital bed. The money collected while I was at the hospital didn't pay for all my bills, but it came surprisingly close. I was really happy and grateful to all the people that took out a moment to spare a dollar or two for me. It may not have been much individually, but when you get hundreds of people, everything adds up. This experience taught me that despite all the pessimism in the world today, there are still good people. Moreover, it shows that every little thing can count, since they can add up over time until the proverbial molehill really does become a mountain. It was a life changing experience for me - literally - and I have since then had a much more positive outlook on life. If people didn't help me at this moment, I would've been financially ruined, and words cannot express my gratitude.] =",recalled, imag,imagined

It turned out to be my best friend from college who I haven't seen in 40 years. She told us that she was engaged to my bothers best friend. I screamed because I was so excited and my husband said ""Congrats!""  So she asked me to be a bridesmaid and I of course said yes! So she showed us the ring and ended up giving us our food for free! Not only was the engagement a surprise but apparently she's the owner of the restaurant too! I couldn't stop, laughing so much good news at once. So my husband and I sat down and got our sandwiches and sides and enjoyed a meal together. Then out of no where he surprised me with plane tickets to Paris next month! What a day! So I cried, again from joy and hugged him. I asked him how he got those tickets because when I looked online it was outrageous-the price that is. He said that our friends were going to go but couldn't because of their job, so he bought them from them for a 60% discount! So needless to say that day was amazing.

            [One of the most memorable events very recently happened to me and I can't stop thinking about it. My husband and I took our first international trip together. Not only was it our first international trip together, it was also our first big trip without our two young children. We have done several small, weekend long trips but never for more than two days at the most. This time, we went to Jamaica and were gone for ten days. It was such an amazing experience. We had the opportunity to get to know each other better and become closer to each other. It has been four years since we had our oldest child. That is four years without real alone time to see who we are without being Mommy and Daddy. We got to just spend ten days in paradise having other people take care of us instead of us taking care of other people. We ate and drank and just had a great time being together.

            [Recently I have been taking my dog to a local park that is connected to a cemetery in order to let her stretch her legs and hunt for squirrels. We are constantly pulling in there and roaming around the whole area, but we very infrequently meet other dogs and their owners while we are in the back woods area of the park. A few months ago, in the spring of this year, we were following the same course as always and we came upon a dog running loose with a collar and tags on its neck. It stopped and was friendly, then continued along the way by itself. Shortly after, me and my dog ran into the owner of the one we had just met, and he was walking another dog on a leash. We said hello to each other and had a brief conversation. I could see that the dog he had on the leash was ill in some way, as opposed to the other healthy dog that was running free. We said goodbye and continued on our separate ways along the trail. A couple of days later, we ran into the same person at the same park but in a different section of the trail. I got to talk to her for a while about how her dog was going to have to have a tumor removed. It was so heartrending to witness an older dog and what getting ill and dying really entails. I was very touched by the whole situation, and I gave her dog a big hug since he was so adorable. After that we did not stay in touch with each other by phone or anything, but I promised to say hi the next time I ran into her there at the park. Sure enough we talked again just a couple of weeks later, and I saw the stitches and the bald spot from the surgery her dog underwent. He was doing well and was happy to meet my dog again, and the two of them ran around until eventually her other dog came back over as well. I felt personally touched by my direct experience with this poor dog, and I also felt good because I was able to contribute to his getting better by sharing some CBD dog treats with his owner. The next time I talked to her, she said that they seemed to have a positive effect on him and that she wanted to thank me for telling her about it.] =",recalled, re,recalled

We woke up early and she wasn't feeling well. She hadn't been feeling well for a while and we were concerned, though we knew that pregnancy was a possibility. By noon, she still felt like she had to throw up constantly, so we made the decision to get a pregnancy test. Since she didn't feel good, I went up to the Dollar Tree alone to get two pregnancy tests. It was a beautiful day outside so I took my time and enjoyed myself on the way there.

All we needed to do was rent a car, book the room, and wait. Up until the day of the planned vacation I packed and planned what to do beforehand. The day finally came, we headed to the car rental place to pick up the vehicle. Transferred all our belongings into the car and we were on our way.

During our stay we went shopping for clothes, rode on a speedboat, ate several restaurants, rode on a skywheel, and just relaxed while looking at the ocean. I would say the speedboat was the most memorable experience. It packed a nice punch of adrenaline and that was just what I needed to take my mind off of the stress. I enjoyed every minute of it. I cannot wait to go back!] =",recalled, re,recalled

            [On the first of October, I got off the plane in a foreign country to see my sister, whom I hadn't seen in nearly four years. We were best friends as kids, almost like twins, so you can imagine how excited I was. Not to mention that it's the longest we'd ever been apart. At the baggage claim area, I didn't see my sister and her fiance yet, but as soon as I picked up the phone to call, she was there. She had dyed her hair, and she had lost weight, but it was still the beloved sister I remembered. We enjoyed a quick hug, but it didn't last long. Her fiance announced in a grumpy tone that our ride was waiting. I had imagined more tears and embraces, but I understood not everything happens how you imagine it. On the car ride to her new in-laws' home, she spoke very little. She spoke more to her fiance than to me, which was strange. She had spent every day with him for four years, and in that time, I hadn't seen her at all. Occasionally, she would grab my hand and smile at me. However, my overall impression was that she was distant. Was she afraid to open up to me? Had she just changed that much? Over the course of the trip, my suspicions were all but confirmed. She barely spoke to me the whole trip. Due to the situation, I couldn't confront her about it. But  returned from the trip feeling as if I'd lost something very important to me.] =",recalled, imag,imagined

            [I went to my sister in law's wedding in April. There I witnessed an exciting and memorable moment. I had to deal with my 2 year old since my daughter and husband were both in the wedding. My son is different than most kids. He might have autism. So during the ceremony itself he was not quiet and couldn't sit still. My husband was holding him. I had to go around the person filming the wedding and take him, missing the ceremony. Before I left though, I noticed that the groom's father and step mother were getting annoyed by my son, casting angry looks back at him and shaking their head. I understand, I do, but I can't just exclude him from events because he is different. I took him to the back and let him run around a little bit. I was really upset by what happened. This is just a little innocent boy. He doesn't think there is anything wrong with him, he is just special. I was offended and got upset because I was just really hurt that someone could look at my baby that way. I was on the verge of tears that someone could treat him that way. He doesn't understand it is time to be quiet, he loves being outside, so he likes to run, it is hard to keep him still. I just wish people would think before casting glances and saying hurtful things. I apologized to my sister in law and her husband but they didn't even care. They love him, they know how he is, and they were sorry for his dad acting the way he did. It made me feel a little better but I was still upset.] =",recalled, re,recalled

            [Tonight is March 17th 2019, one of the most worst days of my life. As I was sitting in my room, I happened to glance outside to the parking lot of my building. I looked in the spot where my car was parked and noticed something odd. It looked like someone was in my car. I got up to take a closer look and sure enough, two people were sitting in my car, rummaging through my belongs. Anger took over me, and without thinking, I ran downstairs to confront them. ""Hey, what the hell are you doing in my car? You know I'm a federal officer, and you just broke into my car??"" I said. One of the men replied, ""so?"" I didn't say anything else, I just turned around to walk back to my apartment so I could call the cops. As I'm coming up the stairs, my roommate is coming downstairs. She had seen everything from the bedroom window and came down to see what was going on. I rushed passed her, heading up the stairs, as I ran past her I told her they just broke into my car and I was calling the police. While I'm running up the stairs, I can hear my roommate trash talking the suspects. Telling them to get a job and things like that. I live on the third floor and by the time I got to the bottom of the third floor stairs I heard my roommate yell out ""he just tried to hit me with a bat"" I hurried as fast as I could to get to my apartment. I grabbed the closest weapon I could find, a knife, and headed back downstairs to help my roommate. I ran up to the guys with the bat and one proceeded to swing at me several times. I put my arm up as he tried to swing for my head, and he broke my arm. Eventually the suspects were arrested. I will never forget this day and how much fear and anger I felt, and still feel to this day. I could have lost my life that night but I'm grateful I didn't.] =",recalled, re,recalled

            [Last month was very interesting to say the least.  Aside from our day to day struggles and hurdles we were hit with 24 hours of shock.  Late one evening I got word that a good friend from childhood had passed away.  This came as a big surprise, he was doing so much better lately.  He had overdosed on Heroin a few years ago and it put him in a bad spot.  He died, but was revived.  When he came back he had brain damage and was stuck in a wheel chair.  He died of a heroin overdose.  Not even 12 hours later I awoke to find that another childhood friend had died.  Again, heroin was to blame.  He suffered with addiction to the drug for years and it finally took him away.  It was a rough few days following.  We just had the final service this last weekend.  The first friend who passed had family who was ashamed of the way he left the world and didn't want to have a formal service.  All of us as friends couldn't accept that.  We held a funeral service for him on Friday, better late than never.  Many friends showed up from around the state.

            [I believe I know of one such story from a few months ago. It happened at a local university library where I read some  very interesting books and fables and books on mistakes and books on business and books on marketing. One day, I decided to take a break from reading business books and instead picked up a book on ancient Persian fables. That is folk tales passed orally down through generations, and then written down by the author. The book was published by the United Nations, it could have been published by UNESCO. Anyway, I picked up the book and started reading. It had some of the most sage advise I could have ever imagined inside of it. I was homeless at the time, so it really helped me set myself straight, and get through. I read one story about a queen who revealed her prince's secret, that he was in fact a prince at night but during the day he had to be ugly and fat, and a serpent if I remember correctly. He came from the Kingdom of Darkness, where everything is black. When the princess revealed this secret, at the behest of her evil aunt, her husband could not re-form into his day form, and had to go back to the Kingdom of Darkness. The princess wore down seven iron rods, and seven pairs of iron shoes, before she could return to the kingdom of darkness. It just goes to show, true love conquers all. In another story, there is a very small girl, perhaps 5 or 6 inches tall, who helps her father, who is very poor. She also stops some robbers from stealing from a rich household. The moral of the story is, no matter how small you are, you can always be of use. But perhaps the most memorable story is, when a man has to go on a cycle to get one end, and the quote goes, even if what you want is in the mouth of a lion, you must go and get it out.] =",recalled, imag,imagined

It was so lovely to see my big brother and give him a hug. We joked and goofed off, just like we did when we were kids, and Paul would sneak into our bedroom, hide himself under the bed, then jump out yelling ""boo!"" so that my sister and I screamed with fright! I was not sure how well he felt, as he had recently recovered from a bout with cancer. He assured us he was fitter than ever, and so we did all the fun things families do when they live close to Disney World. We went to Epcot and Universal and rode many scary rides, ate lots of unhealthy food, and generally had a great time. Although, he kept insisting he was fine, I could tell Paul was getting tired quickly. But we continued on our exciting day, just glad to be in each other's company. When we were back at home, we would sit in the kitchen, each of us with a cup of tea, and reminisce about our childhood. The stories went well into the late hours, and we both were exhausted the next day from staying up too long the previous evening. Those days, I would not bother waking him till late morning, and I could tell he was grateful for the extra rest. I can't believe it's almost time for him to leave. What can I do to make his last few days with us the best ever? I think I will dig out some old board games we used to play and see if he remembers how to play them! He always could beat me though, I will have to try to outwit him! Paul went back home today, I really miss him.

            [A memory that stands out to me was when I adopted a dog from the animal shelter. I had lost my other dog about three months prior to finding my new dog Rusty. I knew it was time to get a new dog and I was excited of the prospect of giving a dog in need a wonderful and loving home that I could provide. When I walked in the shelter I asked to see the dogs that had been there the longest and were most in need. I was introduced to three dogs all of whom had been at the shelter longer than eight months. I locked eyes with a large brown dog sitting in the back of his cage barking. The adoption specialist told me he had been placed in four other current households only to be returned for not fitting into the family's lifestyle and barking to much as well as displaying food aggression at times. She said he would do best in a home where he was the only pet. I opened his cage and held the lead to take him on a walk and he obliged. We walked around the center slowly while he sniffed everything. He was an older dog, the shelter was unsure of his actual age, possibly nine or so. I sat on the bench after our walk and rubbed his ears and he laid his chin on my knee and I knew this dog needed me as much as i needed him. It brought tears to my eyes. I paid for him and took him to my house and he seemed to have boundless amounts of energy running and sniffing everything in sight. I fed him dry kibble topped with canned wet dog food and he lapped it up. That night he seemed nervous so I took him outside what seemed like every hour, he sniffed and barked and continued to stare up at me with those big eyes as to say ""Will you be returning me like the others did""?  Two months later and Rusty has finally begun to accept this is his new home. I feel fortunate I was chosen to be his owner.] =",recalled, re,recalled

            [About 6 months ago I was attending a house warming party for close friends along with my partner, Pat.   This party was taking place in a brand new home that was built in a very small and close-knit town.  As the night went on the party started to wind down and almost everyone had left.  Pat was going to find our friend in the backyard to say goodbye and I went inside to find our other friend to thank her and say goodnight, but she was already asleep upstairs so I went back outside and headed towards my car.  On my way down the dark driveway I was surprised to see a person pace down in the gravel. I got our my phone to use the flashlight and discovered it was Pat, and he was injured badly.  His head had a huge gash and he was bleeding and not very responsive.  I called 911 and gave the dispatcher all of the information I could, but I did not know the address, nor was I familiar with the town or any landmarks.  It took a long time for the paramedics to arrive, and when they started to treat Pat I was approached by 4 sheriffs who wanted to ask me questions.  I tried to give them as much information as I could, but since I was inside when the incident happened I really had no idea how Pat ended up in the state he was in.  Soon, the sheriffs started accusing me of assaulting Pat.  They questioned the homeowners who could not provide any information because one was asleep, and the other was at the far back side of their property cleaning up and putting out the fire we had going earlier.  Nobody heard or saw a thing.  So the natural conclusion for the officers was that I had a baseball bat and bashed in Pats face in the dark driveway.  I was treated like a criminal, and was not able to go with Pat to the hospital or even know what hospital they were taking him to.  Finally, with no evidence or baseball bat weapon to be found, the sheriffs let me go with a stern warning that the case was not closed and they would be watching me closely.  I found what hospital Pat was in, was able to speak to him after treatment, and found out that he had tripped on a tree root in the dark on his way to find our friend and hit his head on a rock.  The doctors and nurses even showed my the bits of gravel they had to dig out of his head.  From that night forward, and even still to this day, the sheriffs drive by my house continuously, often parking nearby and watching me as I go about my day.  It has affected me in a terrible way to be accused of something so awful and to made to feel I could be arrested at any time because of a made up theory that somebody decided must be true of me.] =",recalled, re,recalled

            [I have been writing and performing standup comedy for three, nearly four years. There have been times where IâÃÃ´ve done okay, times where IâÃÃ´ve had an audience of three, and times where IâÃÃ´ve had a full house with uproars of laughter at every punchline. About five months ago, I competed in a stand up comedy night in which comedians were awarded based on audience votes. After a night of 14 talented comedians performing, I won audience favorite comedian and as a result, a handsome cash reward. I felt so much adrenaline and esteem from this experience. Some of my closest friends made the trip to see my performance about an hour and a half from our home. I had my favorite people with me and I was so joyful and excited. I had never felt quite this way before. Audience members were constantly approaching me and praising me for my performance. Some told me I inspired them and some told me they really identified with my style of comedy. They appreciated the work they knew and understood must have gone in to writing and practicing my set. I felt so rewarded by my emotions and the cash prize was simply a bonus. I still keep a twenty from that cash prize as a reminder that what I do is worthwhile.

I did not anticipate my husband would be mad. He seemed to think it was disloyal of me to have drinks with someone he clashed with so badly in the past. He thinks Ryan only invited me to prove that I would go have drinks with him and not because Ryan just enjoys me company as a platonic friend. This turned into a fairly big dustup between my husband and I, and we never really fight! So I was surprised that it got to be so heated. He was offended that I would ""betray"" him, even though nothing romantic AT ALL HAPPENED, not even a little. Meanwhile, I was offended that he thinks someone wouldn't just enjoy my company in general and would only invite me somewhere to prove a point. Plus, I was in a group of friends, not one on one! To me it seemed like no big deal. I struggled to see his point of view. I did not want to apologize for something that didn't seem wrong to me. And my husband ended up apologizing, but then when I didn't apologize also, he got mad again and retracted his apology.

A friend of mine from work would be coming to check on the cat every few days to make sure the cat had enough food and she was comfortable.   A few weeks before the cruise, my landlord was concerned about my bathroom.  He thought there might be a leak in the bathroom, and there might be mold.  He inspected my bathroom and decided that the tiles should be replaced.   A few days before I would be leaving, the landlord brought some people over to check my bathroom.

            [I was born in a small city in San Jose, where I lived in a rich neighborhood surrounded by multi-storey buildings. My mother and father parted ways when I was just 4 years old, and I lived with my mom and two older brothers. I rarely saw my father, although he was still a part of my life and made me try different sports or went bicycling with me. I rarely dwell in the past and sometimes my distant memories even seem to be from another personâÃÃ´s life. I have changed so much over the years that I often wonder what kind of magic lead me to this current place. I am so used to my new self that sometimes I canâÃÃ´t even explain my transformation. Everything has become so natural that if someone asked me how can I be so happy or peaceful, then itâÃÃ´s possible that I wouldnâÃÃ´t know the answer. Happiness just seems to be the natural state for humans. Why should I be miserable? However, that kind of attitude wouldâÃÃ´ve been a complete utopia many years back, because I felt like the most unfortunate person alive. When i was 9 years old, waiting for one of my best friendâÃÃ´s birthday party after 3rd grade school ceremony. I was also invited to my grandmotherâÃÃ´s birthday by my family, but I chose to stay home and go to my friendâÃÃ´s place instead. But before that I went to a nearby shop to buy some snacks. There I met a few friends, who wished for some excitement. I still had about 2 hours until the birthday party so I decided to join them. There was an abandoned and fenceless construction site near my home, which was our typical playground. We had gone there dozens of times before to play games or have a picnic. On that day the four of us decided to play hide and seek, so we split into two teams. We crawled through the hollow spaces of long blocks of concrete, made silent movements and scouted around the place, sometimes lifting our heads up to see where the other boys were located. I felt very excited like normally. Nothing seemed to be different. But suddenlyâÃÂ¶ after my teammate had finished scouting, he jumped off a concrete block which was insecurely supported by another. The jump caused the block to lose its balance while I was directly in front of it. As soon as I realized that, I was already on the ground face down, noticing only some dust flying around.] =",recalled, imag,imagined

            [A few months ago, I attended a political rally. I had never been to a rally in my life but this new presidential candidate really interested me. I heard about him on the Joe Rogan podcast. He was talking about providing people with universal basic income. His name is Andrew Yang. When I heard that he was coming to Los Angeles, I knew I had to make it out to see him. I invited my friend and we took the train to see him. I was worried that no one was going to show up because he was very unknown. When we got there I was shocked by how many people were actually there. It was a very diverse group as well. There were people from all different backgrounds. During his speech, I could see how pumped people were getting. When he ended his speech, people were cheering his name. On the train ride bike, people kept talking about him. For the first time in my life, I felt like change was possible. I fully believe in a president for the first time ever.] =",recalled, imag,imagined

            [In late May I lost my dog. She was old for a mastiff, 13 years old. I still wasn't ready though. She had been going downhill steadily but it didn't feel like enough time to prepare. I think a part of me knew that it was coming the day before. She was acting off and wasn't interested in much. I had made the decision that if she didn't improve in a day I would have her euthanized. The morning it happened I woke up and she had thrown up on the bed. She perked up for a little while and I placed her on her bed on the floor to spend some time with her before I called the vet. I held her head on my lap and pet her. This day was also the memorial service for my uncle that had just passed away. So I was home alone. It seemed like it happened so quickly. One moment she was there. And then the next moment she was gone and I was cradling her head on my lap sobbing uncontrollably. I had never felt more alone in my life than I did at that moment.] =",recalled, imag,imagined

            [My cousin got married about three months ago. Her husband's father owns a farm up in the country, and that's where they had the wedding. It was a beautiful view of the fields at the ceremony, but it was way too hot for an outdoor wedding. The reception was inside one of the storage facilities, so that didn't help. They were having issues with the food too, as there wasn't enough of it and they had to order pizza. It was nice going and seeing family members I hadn't seen in a long time. We got a big picture with all the cousins together. Some of my cousins live in England, so it was great to see them and catch up. The most memorable thing about the wedding was the video they played about my cousin and her husband's history. It was well put together and emotional. Once it got dark the heat wasn't so bad, and at least the portable bathrooms they provided were air conditioned. It was only an hour away from where I live too so it was an easy drive back and forth. They offered hotels for any guests who wanted to stay the night, but I'd rather sleep in my own bed. It was definitely a memorable night. I don't get out to the country often.] =",recalled, imag,imagined

            [Last weekend, I attended my nephew's birthday party.  He turned 3 years old.  It was a lovely event with several kids who came to play at the party, and then a small handful of adults.  It was laid back.  They decided to try to get the birthday cake last minute, and it took several hours for them to find a place that could bake a cake last minute.  While we were served dinner, it was quite late by the time we were able to eat because we had to wait until the cake arrived before we could eat.  But, eventually it did arrive and we ate dinner together.  Next, my nephew decided it was time to start opening presents.  He started without telling anyone, and his parents were out of the room when he started.  They were surprised to find that he opened almost all of his presents before they were able to watch him.  We all laughed at his eagerness to open the gifts!  I think he wanted to open the gifts because he was most excited about eating the cake, and wanted to be able to do that as soon as possible.  He blew out his candle and immediately started picking off the cake decorations and icing and eating it.  The cake was quickly pulled away, so he wouldn't eat all of the toppings.  At the end, we were each served a slice of cake.  It was a very enjoyable afternoon/evening.] =",recalled, re,recalled

He has no clue how to dress, but he is an attorney and is so cute. He has this way of listening where you feel like you are the center of his world. I love that. And he remembers everything which is really great. I have a way of ranting and he listens to my rants and helps as best he can, even if it's just the listening. We met on his first day at my office, and I thought he was cute. Now, we are working closely on a case together and I get to talk to him frequently, as he is the attorney on my case and will be talking to the judge about it. I am really happy to be working with him. I don't know what will happen in the future between us. Hopefully, he will ask me out after this hearing.

            [Last weekend, I went on a camping trip with twelve friends and family members. It was the largest group I've ever gone camping with, and I was nervous about how it would go. Lucky for me, the two women who planned the trip were very thorough and considerate. The food was plentiful and delicious. There were more than enough tents to house everyone. The kayaks and paddle boards we rented were firmly secured and easily made the trip into the mountains. The two trucks we took also managed to cart us and our equipment without complaining. They're both old, so I had been worried about that.    I grew up in a pretty inactive family. We went camping a lot when I was little, but didn't actually do outdoor activities. Then my dad's back started to bother him, and we stopped camping. Last year I went camping again for the first time in over a decade and slept terribly. Thankfully, my body got over that during a week-long river rafting trip in April. It helps that I now have the right equipment and mindset to successfully sleep while camping.   This was my first time on both a kayak and a paddle board. I enjoyed both, but I loved the single-seat kayak. I want to buy one now. I live near a lake, but I don't have a reliable way to transport a kayak, so it'll have to wait for a bit. The reason I chose to journal about this trip was that it's a testament to the growth that I and my friends have made in the last couple of years. I used to be terrified of trying anything new, especially anything physical. I'm not afraid to test the limits of my body anymore. I know I can handle a lot more than I used to think I could, and I know that it's okay to not be great at something the first time you try it. And my friends and siblings have flourished into full-fledged adults. It was an enjoyable, fortifying experience. I hope we do it again soon.] =",recalled, imag,imagined

            [When I was a kid,say 10 years old ,I'd walk into my parents' home ,like after school, and I'd feel this  great almost suffocating feeling of energy and warmth and love. The energy from my mother,father,our dog,--it was such a comforting feeling. Then when I was 14,my mother died. I'd walk into the house and I'd still feel that energy feeling,that feeling of energy ,warmth,and love. It was much reduced but with my father and our dog, it was still there. And then when I was 24,  the dog died. The energy that I had felt in that house,the feeling of love and warmth that had comforted me for so long, was greatly reduced. It  felt like it was almost gone,a shadow of what it once was. And then 4 months ago,I walked into the house to visit my father. I walked in ....and I felt nothing. No energy,no warmth,no love feeling. It felt like I had walked into someone else's house. I actually stepped right back outside after I walked in and looked at the address numbers to make sure I had the right house. That's how strange it felt. I walked through the house. I looked in my old room and felt nothing. The dining room,living room ,rec room,scene of a thousand adventures , and  I felt nothing, only a cold, icy stillness. I looked into my father's bedroom. I felt nothing. I saw that he  was in bed asleep so I didn't disturb him. It was only later when I thought  back about it  did it dawn on me how silent and still my father's room had been. My  father had a heart attack and died in bed,perhaps an hour before I arrived. Everyone who had made that house a home had died. The energy ,love warmth,everything  was gone. It was just an empty house.  I sold it as quickly as I could. There was nothing left for me there. I could not stand to be in the house again remembering what it once was- a home filled with love.] =",recalled, imag,imagined

When I came back from walking my dog, he was repeatedly lying down and getting back up. I called the vet, and he came and gave him meds to ease the pain and help him feel better. He also left a couple meds with me to administer if Corky got bad again. Unfortunately, within an hour, Corky started rolling again. I gave him the meds, and had to wait an hour for the vet to return. It took what seemed like forever, while my beloved horse was dying. I sat with him while he laid on the ground, and talked to him. I kept looking at my watch. It was unbearable to see him in so much pain. The vet came, and I got Corky outside. Then the vet euthanized him immediately. In the morning, everything had been so normal, and so quickly everything changed. By evening, he had been buried, and was gone.] =",recalled, imag,imagined

            [About six months ago, I went to the eye doctor to get my eyes checked. My eyes were getting tired quickly and I was experiencing a lot of mild headaches due to eyestrain. The doctor did a thorough examination and immediately noticed how terribly misaligned they were. He recommended me to a surgeon to get my eyes aligned. I have had misaligned eyes for almost half a century and had never considered surgery, because my older sister had surgery for her misaligned eyes and is now practically blind in one eye. I had decided to live with my condition and when I became an adult, I went through one year of vision therapy to correct the problem. Vision therapy did help, but over time my eyes went back to their old ways and turned in very significantly. The doctor explained to me that my condition is a little different from my sister's and that surgery will not cause me to lose vision, because I have alternating vision and my sister had another condition that caused her to shut one eye off completely. He said that at my age, surgery was really the only answer. So, I scheduled an appointment with a surgeon and had an evaluation done. The surgeon put all kinds of different prisms up to my left eye and immediately I saw double. The surgeon worked with me for several minutes and finally my eyes adjusted some. She told me that my left eye turned inward 70-80 points and she could only correct it to 40 points without me seeing double. She decided that it would be beneficial to do surgery on my right eye also, so that I can have at least 50 points of correction. I talked to my husband about the situation and he thought it was a good idea to have the surgery done. The surgery scheduler didn't contact me until three months later and informed me that I would have to go back down for a new evaluation before the surgery. I told her that if this was the case, I was not interested, because we had already paid $600 out of pocket for the first evaluation. She talked with the surgeon and the surgeon told her that I did not need a second evaluation, so the surgery was scheduled for August. Three weeks ago, my husband took me to the eye hospital and I underwent surgery on both of my eyes and I cannot believe how having mostly aligned eyes has changed my life! My crossed eyes have always caused people to look at me a little funny and some companies have not wanted to hire me, thinking there was something wrong with me. Children have always stared at me and asked why my eyes are so crossed. This is no longer a problem! Just last week, I took a trip into town to the grocery store and was amazed at how much better I was treated. It is also wonderful to get up in the morning and have almost perfectly aligned eyes while looking in the mirror getting ready for the day!] =",recalled, imag,imagined

            [This happened about 3 months ago.  I was driving with my brother back from the movie theater when we were sideswiped by another car.  It spun us around into the median and was completely terrifying.  It really came out of nowhere and gave me no time to react or take any preventative measures.  We both looked at each other shocked when we came to a stop.  We checked on each other to make sure we were both okay, which we were.  We got out of my car to assess the damage and make sure the other driver was okay.  They other driver got out of their car and were obviously under the influence.  You could see the wobble in them from 20 feet away.  My car, which was pretty new, was smashed in the rear driver side, but not as bad as I would have thought.  The other driver looked to be in his mid 20s and started to freak out a bit when he realized that we were calling the police.  The police go there really quickly and gave the guy a field sobriety test which he failed miserably.  I exchanged information with on of the officers while we waited for a tow truck to come.  The other driver was arrested and my car was towed away.  It is the only major accident I've ever been in besides one or two small fender benders in parking lots.  Surprisingly, my car was mostly okay.  It's a 2012 Subaru Legacy that I spent a lot of time saving up for.  I'm not entirely sure what happened to the other driver, but his insurance settled out with us.  Ironically, my car was salvaged out about a month later due to hail damage (somehow that was more costly than this accident).] =",recalled, re,recalled

            [This is a story that I'm not too proud of. One night last June after having a few (or more than a few) cocktails at a bar about 1 mile from my house, I decided to walk home instead of drive. I was pretty drunk and got to about 3 blocks from my house. Of course being drunk, I decided to text a woman that I know, and see if she'd respond. She did and as I was walking I was texting her back. I wasn't watching where I was walking and ended up taking a fall after tripping over a piece of sidewalk that was sticking up from tree roots growing under it. I not only hit my head but didn't catch myself correctly and dislocated my shoulder. I knew I was hurt pretty badly and it was late at night. I was drunk enough to think that I would be better off if I just laid here for a while. I was only one block from a hospital but didn't want to get up and go there. I ended up making the decision to get up (after over 30 minutes) and try to make it home. I didn't realize the extent of my injury so that's what I thought would be best. I got up and walked the 3 blocks to my house, got in the front door, laid down and passed out. I slept for a good 2 hours or so and when I woke up in a pool of blood, and realized that my shoulder was injured badly. I decided I better go to the hospital. I got up and walked to the emergency room. I ended up getting a stitch in my nose and having my arm put back in the socket. I recovered pretty quickly and was okay after a few weeks, but it was a significant event in my life. I will never be walking drunk and texting again in the dark. Bad things can happen.] =",recalled, re,recalled

            [The night my fourth baby was born was extremely exciting and unexpected.  I was thirty six weeks and six days pregnant and not anticipating to have him for a few more weeks.  I have my fourth c-section scheduled already.  I was sitting at home with my husband and I noticed that I did not feel him moving as much as he normally did at night.  I got worried and called the doctor and they wanted me to go in to the hospital for monitoring.  I went in and they kept me overnight and monitored his heartrate.  His heart kept dropping which was really concerning so first thing that morning they decided to go ahead and do a c-section for his safety.  There was a lot of build up to that point where they weren't sure what they were going to do.  They kept rushing in the room every time his heart rate would drop and it was really scary to me.  I just wanted to be sure my baby was okay.  Finally they came in and announced they were going to go ahead with the surgery.  I was really nervous and excited because I had left home with just my purse and had no idea I'd be having surgery and finally meeting my little baby the next morning, but I couldn't wait to have him in my arms plus I was worried about his safety because of what was going on.  Everything happened really fast after that and within an hour or so they were pulling him out and I heard his little cries and they brought him to me so I could see his little face for the first time.  My husband wasn't there with me in the operating room so the anesthesiologist sat right beside me and held him beside me so I could see him while they finished the surgery. It turns out he had a full knot in his umbilical cord which apparently is really rare but can be very dangerous for the baby.  It was very fortunate that I had come in to be monitored and the doctor had decided to go ahead with the c-section.  I went to recovery and sat there just examining his little face and falling in love with him for the first time.  I stayed in the hospital with him for a few days and then was finally able to go home and introduce him to my other three children and my husband.  I still cherish that time in the hospital with him where it was just the two of us one on one and I finally had him in my arms.  To me he is my little miracle baby.

We all stayed in the same house and spent the evenings cooking together, watching movies and generally bonding and learning about each others lives and experiences.

            [The diagnosis of endometriosis will be with me for as long as I live.  My journey started with the abdominal pain and has now lead me to treatment for infertility with some amazing doctors.  I had been having abdominal pain for years and was told by three different doctors that I just had scar tissue from a previous surgery and it would probably get better. Needless to say,  it only got worse.  I had to go for surgery for an infection in my abdominal wall which ended up being not infection, just inflammation from the endometriosis.  They did a biopsy of a ""mass"" as the doctor called it, which ended up being endometriosis.  With this new diagnosis, I then knew why I have been unable to have kids and that was for sure the reason I hurt almost constantly for the past several years. Finally in May I was able to start the fertility treatments. I was so excited and overwhelmed. That now give me the hope that one day I will possibly be having my own little baby.  It has been a trying time and for sure a very emotional one. The hormones make me feel, at times, that I am going to go crazy,  but in the long run I know it will be well worth the wait. I have an enormous support system. My doctors, friends, family and my boyfriend have been by my side the whole time since I have started with the fertility specialists.  The pills I take are usually not that bad on me,  however the shot that I have to take is what really gets me.  I have to stick myself in the belly with a NEEDLE!! I never saw myself being able to do that. The shot leaves a small red spot around where I take it and it is a little sore for several days. We have already finished three rounds of the medication and shots only.  I think we are going to try and start IUI/IVF in the next few months to give us a greater chance of having a baby.  I know that it will help me to increase my chances of pregnancy. Hopefully in the next year we will be welcoming our own little baby into this world. I CAN'T WAIT!!] =",recalled, imag,imagined

            [I was celebrating my daughter's 8th birthday party.  We were just having a simple family party, but we were taking it to the next level.  I wanted to make it fun and lively.  I purchased a bunch of pink flamingo decor to decorate the walls and tables.  I purchased a cute flamingo puffy straw to adorn the party cups.  I played music by Marshmello, who is her favorite musician.  For her gifts, I purchased her a bunch of squishes, and some play make up.  We had all of her cousins come, which totaled about 10 kids.  We had games like pinata hitting, hula hoop competition, and limbo.  Her cake I decorated pink and purple with many pastel colored sprinkles.  This birthday was a large celebration as she has always dreamed of having a horse again.  Unfortunately, our property is small and we could no longer afford the board in our area for a horse.  So, we sold the one we had years ago.  This year, I was able to gift her with something that most people wouldn't even think would matter to a young girl.  I was able to tell her we were buying a house out in the country that had enough acreage for a horse!  She was over the moon excited.  Our little half acre lot that we lived in would eventually turn into 10 acres in our new home.  She would have the room to ride and play like she had always dreamt of doing.] =",recalled, imag,imagined

I got called for an interview in a city that was about 5 hours drive from where i stay. I decided to embark on this journey that faithful day of the interview. On getting to the location was not too easy for i was running late for the interview.  Getting there i finished and headed back to my place. I am having issues in my relationship, my girlfriend is not making me happy and she is taking me for granted in which i have been sober for almost 3 months no. I boarded a bus back lucky for me a young pretty lady sat next to me i was a bit happy because she was my type of girl. she later changed sit. with i was not really happy about, i never wanted to loose on both ends because i did not get the job. i wanted someone to talk to and make me happy. She was sitting behind me, she tapped me on my shoulder and asked if i could lend her my pen, there and then i knew she noticed me then i initiated a conversation and asked her to come sit beside me, to my surprise she did. we talked all through the journey, for those hours i forgot about my worries, i was happy. she is nice and friendly. Her gaze, her smile her voice is everything i can think about right now.] =",recalled, imag,imagined

            [I lost my job 5 month ago at the company that I worked for 8 years. It was my first real job after college. My family lives in Europe now so they were too far away to help me. I was getting so depressed and was feeling like I was failing in life. My best friend who lives in another state asked me if I would consider moving to another state because she would be able to help me and support me through this hard time in my life. I was so worried because the only person I knew there was her and I didn't want to make my problems hers. I really didn't have any other options so I agreed to move to Texas. I knew that they had a lot of jobs for engineers so I was hopeful to find a job pretty fast. Within a month I moved to Texas. It was stressful but my girlfriend was so supportive. She even let me stay with her for 2 month while I was looking for a new apartment and was sending my resumes to the companies. She drove me to my interviews because my car was not delivered there yet. It really showed me how good of a friend she is and this experience made us even closer. A friend in need is a friend indeed. This situation taught me how string I am and that there is nothing I cannot do if I set my mind to it.] =",recalled, imag,imagined
